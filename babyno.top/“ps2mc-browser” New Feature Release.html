<p><code>ps2mc-browser</code> is a <code>PS2</code> memory card file viewer that utilizes an <code>OpenGL</code> canvas to display 3D dynamic icons from the memory card. It relies on the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python3</li>
<li>WxPython</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>ModernGL</li>
<li>PyGlm</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Features</h2>
<p>Some <code>PS2</code> game memory card files contain three sets of different animated icons, corresponding to three different operations: "browse," "copy," and "delete."</p>
<p>The newly released feature allows the <code>ps2mc-browser</code> interface not only to display animated icons but also to interact with users and respond to mouse operations. Consequently, the animation of icons can vary based on user selection.</p>

<h2>Other Updates</h2>
<p>The background pattern of each animated memory card icon is stored in the <code>icon.sys</code> file (refer to <a href="../../10/parsing-ps2-3d-icon">Parsing PS2 Game Memory Card 3D Icons</a> for details). In reality, it has transparency, which is more apparent on a physical <code>PS2</code> console.</p>
<p>Therefore, when rendering the background in <code>OpenGL</code>, an additional layer of <code>skybox</code> is added behind the <code>bg</code> background layer. The <code>z</code> coordinates of these two layers are distributed as <code>0.99</code> and <code>0.999</code>, and the <code>RGBA</code> of the <code>skybox</code> is <code>(0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 1)</code> opaque. This setup ensures that if the <code>bg</code> has transparency, the color of the <code>skybox</code> will be displayed.</p>
<p>Taking <code>Viewtiful Joe</code> as an example, its <code>bg</code> has <code>100%</code> transparency. Without the <code>skybox</code>, the effect would be as follows:</p>

<p>With the <code>skybox</code> added, the effect is as follows:</p>

<h2>Unresolved Issues</h2>
<p>The problem with lighting has not been resolved, resulting in incorrect lighting for many games and poor display effects. For more details, refer to <a href="../../10/parsing-ps2-3d-icon">Parsing PS2 Game Memory Card 3D Icons</a>.</p>
