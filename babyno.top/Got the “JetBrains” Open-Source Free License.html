<p>Remember three months ago I open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/caol64/ps2mc-browser">ps2mc-browser</a> project on GitHub, a magical little tool that can view and render 3D icons of PS2 archives. Occasionally pushing code, adding features, and now finally releasing its first stable version.</p>
<p>Then I turned my attention to JetBrains' "Open Source Development Licenses".</p>
<h2>JetBrains Licenses for Open Source Development</h2>
<p><code>JetBrains</code> is a company dedicated to building the most intelligent and efficient development tools. They offer a program called "Open Source Development Licenses" to support developers who contribute to the open-source community.</p>
<p>For this reason, I submitted an application to JetBrains. Surprisingly, the application process was much simpler than I had imagined. It only required providing relevant information about the project, such as the project's link, open-source license type, project activity status, etc., and then submitting the form, waiting for approval from JetBrains officials.</p>
<h2>Application Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Must comply with the open-source definition, with project source code publicly available and covered by relevant open-source licenses such as the <code>MIT</code> License, <code>Apache 2.0</code>, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regular development is required, meaning new code should be submitted every month. JetBrains will automatically check the project's activity over the past three months. This does not include non-code contributions (e.g., <code>README.md</code>, <code>.txt</code>) and content submitted by <code>Dependabot</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The project must meet the conditions of being software, such as being a framework, library, plugin, or application. It does not apply to code examples, blogs, or <code>LeetCode</code> solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project documentation must be appropriately done, such as providing detailed <code>README</code> files, code of conduct, contribution guidelines, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The project must not be continuously funded by commercial companies or organizations (NGOs, educational, research, or governmental). Compensation for server/infrastructure costs and accepting one-time voluntary donations is allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project developers should voluntarily maintain the project in their free time, without support for contributors working during working hours or paid freelance contributors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only free versions of the software are provided, without offering any commercial services related to the project, such as paid support, consulting, customer bug fixes, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Free licenses are only provided to core project contributors who regularly contribute to the project, and these contributions should be visible in the repository.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>JetBrains All Products Pack</h2>
<p>After waiting for 2 days, I received an email from JetBrains informing me that my application had been approved and providing a license for the <code>JetBrains All Products Pack</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="JetBrains All Products Pack" src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/babyno.top/content/imgs/posts/2023-12-31-apply-for-jetbrains-oss-development-license/截屏2023-12-31%2015.56.31.webp"/></p>
<p>JetBrains' <code>All Products Pack</code> license covers almost all the functionalities I need. From <code>IntelliJ IDEA</code> for Java, <code>PyCharm</code> for Python, <code>WebStorm</code> for front-end development to <code>DataGrip</code> for data analysis, and many other products.</p>
<p>What does this mean for me? It simply means I have more options to execute my work, thereby enhancing my work efficiency and programming quality.</p>
<p>To put it more directly, with this "comprehensive license," I no longer have to hesitate about purchasing the premium version or worry about the trial period ending. I can find more focus for my work, especially for open-source projects.</p>
<p>Within JetBrains' products, each one is an excellent, efficient development tool, benefiting countless professional developers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm grateful for JetBrains' strong support for the open-source community. Similarly, I hope my experience might help maintainers or developers of other open-source projects. Don't be afraid to try; bravely apply for your open-source license because perhaps the next one to receive a pleasant surprise could be you.</p>
