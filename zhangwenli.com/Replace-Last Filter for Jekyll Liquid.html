excerpt: There are only &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;replace-last&lt;/code&gt; filter in Liquid gramma. So how can we replace the last character in Jekyll? This post introduces an ad-hoc method to do this, as well as how to make a &lt;em&gt;View Source on GitHub&lt;/em&gt; feature.</li>

<h1>Why did I need this filter?</h1>
<p>I was making a <em>View Source in GitHub</em> feature for my blog and needed to replace <code>/</code> with <code>-</code> in <code>{{ "{{ page.url" }}}}</code>, which is <code>/2014/07/15/jekyll/related/posts/without/plugin/</code>, so as to generate a link like <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ovilia/blog/gh-pages/_posts/2014-07-15-jekyll-related-posts-without-plugin.md</code>.</p>
<p>As we can see, <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ovilia/blog/gh-pages/_posts/</code> and <code>.md</code> remains always the same. So we just need to get <code>2014-07-15-jekyll-related-posts-without-plugin</code> from <code>/2014/07/15/jekyll/related/posts/without/plugin/</code>, which seems to be a piece of cake, right?</p>
<h2>No! Not with Liquid.</h2>
<h1><code>replace</code> and <code>remove-first</code></h1>

<p>We can use <code>replace</code> to replace <code>/</code> with <code>-</code>. But we want to get rid of the first and last <code>/</code> in <code>/2014/07/15/jekyll/related/posts/without/plugin/</code>. The first <code>/</code> can be easily removed using <code>remove-first</code>, but how about the last one?</p>
<p>Apparently, there's no Liquid filter we can use. But you have to do something to stay alive with Liquid. :smirk:</p>
<h1><code>append</code>?!</h1>
<p>As traditional Chinese philosophy told us, <em>One must first give, when he wants to get</em>. When we can't find any solution to <em>remove</em>, why not consider <em>append</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One must first open, when he wants to close.<br/>
One must first strengthen it, when he wants to weaken something.<br/>
One must first embrace, when he wants to abolish.<br/>
One must first give, when he wants to get.</p>

<p>We first append a character which is considered never to be in the post URL. For example, we choose <code>@</code> here and put our trust on it that it will never betray us. :joy:</p>
<p>Append <code>@</code> to the end of the string and remove <code>-@</code> helps to remove the last <code>-</code> in the original string.</p>
<p>The complete code is:</p>
