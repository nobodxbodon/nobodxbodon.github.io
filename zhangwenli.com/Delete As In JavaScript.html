<blockquote>
<p>The delete operator removes a property from an object. Its single operand should be a property access expression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 6th Edition</em></p>

<p><code>delete</code> is used to remove a properpty from an object.</p>
<p>{% highlight js %}
var a = {x: 2, y: 3};
delete a.x; // Returns true; <code>a</code> is changed to be {y: 3}
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>But there are circumstances that we may expect the wrong result from it. Here's what <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em> tells us.</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; expression evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the delete succeeded or if the delete had no effect (such as deleting a nonexistent property). &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; also evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; when used (meaninglessly) with an expression that is not a property access expression:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>{% highlight js %}
o = {x:1};         // o has own property x and inherits property toString
delete o.x;        // Delete x, and return true
delete o.x;        // Do nothing (x doesn't exist), and return true
delete o.toString; // Do nothing (toString isn't an own property), return true
delete 1;          // Nonsense, but evaluates to true
delete a.x;        // returns true and <code>a</code> is changed to be {y: 3}
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; does not remove properties that have a configurable attribute of &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. (Though it will remove configurable properties of nonextensible objects.) Certain properties of built-in objects are nonconfigurable, as are properties of the global object created by variable declaration and function declaration. In strict mode, attempting to delete a nonconfigurable property causes a TypeError. In non-strict mode (and in ECMAScript 3), &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; simply evaluates to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in this case:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>{% highlight js %}
delete Object.prototype; // Can't delete; property is non-configurable
var x = 1;               // Declare a global variable
delete this.x;           // Can't delete this property
function f() {}          // Declare a global function
delete this.f;           // Can't delete this property either
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 6th Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>As mentioned several times above, what is <em>configurable</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>configurable</em> attribute controls at the same time whether the property can be deleted from the object and whether its attributes (other than writable) can be changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty#Configurable_attribute" target="_blank"&gt;<em>Object.defineProperty() - JavaScript | MDN</em>&lt;/a&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be careful when deleting on global objects. Here are some interesting results that may be confusing.</p>
<p>{% highlight js %}
// In global scope
var x = 1;  delete this.x; // Returns false;
y = 1;      delete this.y; // Returns true;
this.z = 1; delete this.z; // Returns true;</p>
<p>var x = 1;  delete x;      // Returns false;
y = 1;      delete y;      // Returns true;
this.z = 1; delete z;      // Returns true;
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Why? How is <code>x</code> different from <code>y</code> in this case?</p>
<p>We know that <code>y</code>, an undeclared variable can be used in almost the same way like declared variables like <code>x</code>. Then, how are they different in this case?</p>
<p>&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1306809/matt-coughlin" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Coughlin&lt;/a&gt; gives a very clear &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15985875/effect-of-declared-and-undeclared-variables#answer-16007360" target="_blank"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; to this question, which I'd suggest reading. To be brief, for declared global variables, the <em>configurable</em> attribute is <code>false</code>. For undeclared global variables, it's <code>true</code>. And properties can be deleted only when it's <code>configurable</code> attribute is <code>true</code>.</p>
