excerpt: Front-end techniques that I plan to learn in 2014.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I was quite busy lately and it has been a month since my <a href="http://zhangwenli.com/blog/2013/11/02/sorting-in-javascript/">last post</a>. I didn't learn something new and I felt a little shameful about it. :cry:</p>
<p>There are courses about which I don't care much but have to spend enough time nevertheless. There are research works I'm eager to make some progress on but still at a loss. There are, as always, decisions to make and promises to keep.</p>
<p>Last week, I visited a small developing IT company, and was somehow being interviewed as a web front-end programmer. Hopefully, I didn't disappoint the CTO too much, but I did see how much more effort I had to put to be a competent front-end designer.</p>
<p>Before that day, I thought I was good enough as a front-end programmer. But after the interview, I came to realize that knowing about how to design and implement is not the whole story. I knew about most techniques that I was asked about, but had little experience of using them personally. To be frank, I usually won't learning something new when I don't have to, since the <em>opportunity cost</em> of learning something new is increasing and increasing. And my pride and complacent are another reasons prevent me from learning.</p>
<p>I thought seriously about this after that interview and was very thankful for the CTO's questions. I really need to learn these popular techniques and polish myself before I'm ready to be a web front-end designer.</p>
<p>Here's a list of things I plan to learn through projects in 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>RequireJS</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>JavaScript Template Engine</li>
<li>JavaScript Language Feature</li>
<li>JavaScript Design Pattern</li>
<li>LESS</li>
<li>SASS</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe the winter holiday is a time to take a break, or an opportunity to carry on. :grin:</p>
