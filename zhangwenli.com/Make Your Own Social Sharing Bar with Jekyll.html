<h1>Sharing Service</h1>
<p>SNS usually provides sharing service that takes parameters in URL and then generates a sharing post. Take &lt;a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for example, we can enter the following address in the address bar, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=hello+world&amp;url=http://google.com" target="_blank"&gt;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=hello+world&amp;url=http://google.com&lt;/a&gt;. Since I'm logged in as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OviliaZhang" target="_blank"&gt;@OviliaZhang&lt;/a&gt;, I can see something like this.</p>

<h1>Using Jekyll</h1>
<h2>Generate Static Link</h2>
<p>The following steps are quite clear.</p>
<p>We first get information (e.g. page title, url, and etc.) from Jekyll and then use that to generate static page. For example, in a post layout, I can write the following code.</p>
<p>&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/Ovilia/906e8a1ed4bfdae5d9a3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<h2>Add Tags</h2>
<p>Further more, we can add tags to this post.</p>
<p>Twitter uses tag lists in the URL in the form of <code>tag=apple,orange,banana</code>. So we can use <code>capture</code> to do this.</p>
<p>&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/Ovilia/e479e5b17fb2b49a67a4.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>In each iteration, a tag in <code>page.tags</code> is appended to <code>tagStr</code> following with a comma.</p>
<h2>Shorten URL</h2>
<p>Since Twitter allows at most 140 characters in each tweet, we'd better shorten our post URL, which can be sometimes as long as <code>http://zhangwenli.com/blog/2014/07/30/04-more-about-css-position/</code>.</p>
<p>We can use URL shorten services like &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/" target="_blank"&gt;https://goo.gl/&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Google Plus, however, you may probably want to use original URL rather than shortened one, since it will fail to craw content if you use the shortened URL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After we get the shortened URL, we should add it to each post.</p>

<p>Then, in the post layout, we should check if <code>shortUrl</code> is <code>null</code>, so that we don't have to add <code>shortUrl</code> to all of our old posts.</p>

<h1>Prepare SNS Icons</h1>
<p>As we said, we are making our own sharing bar since we want it looks well with our blog style, so you need to make SNS icons to fit with blog.</p>
<p>Icons I used are modified based on the works by Daniel Bruce, Elegant Themes, Freepik, SimpleIcon, Icomoon from &lt;a href="http://www.flaticon.com" title="Flaticon"&gt;www.flaticon.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great place to find licensed icons.</p>
<h1>Final Results</h1>
<p>Other sharing services are quite similar. I've implemented that of Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, LinkedIn, and Sina Weibo. Here's the complete code.</p>
