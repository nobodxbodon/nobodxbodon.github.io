<h3><strong>DNS: The Phone Book Itself</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it is:</strong> The <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> is the system that translates the friendly website names you type (like <code>google.com</code>) into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to find each other (like <code>142.251.42.206</code>). It's the actual <em>lookup process</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Analogy:</strong> DNS is the <strong>phone book</strong>. You look up a name (e.g., "Jane's Pizza"), and it gives you the phone number you need to call to reach them.</li>
<li><strong>Key Purpose:</strong> <strong>Finding the correct server.</strong> It answers the question: <strong>"Where is this website located?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>WHOIS: The "Who Owns This?" Section</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it is:</strong> <strong>WHOIS</strong> is a protocol and a database that stores information about <strong>who registered a domain name</strong>. It's a directory of who owns what.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Analogy:</strong> WHOIS is like the section in the phone book that lists <strong>who the phone number is registered to</strong>, their address, and when they registered it. It's about ownership and registration details.</li>
<li><strong>Key Purpose:</strong> <strong>Identifying the domain owner.</strong> It answers the questions: <strong>"Who owns this website?"</strong>, "When did they register it?", and "How can I contact them?"</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>A Simple Example</strong></h3>
<p>Let's say you want to visit <code>example.com</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your computer uses DNS:</strong> It's like your computer shouting, "Hey, everyone, what's the address for <code>example.com</code>?!" A DNS server answers back, "It's <code>93.184.216.34</code>!" Your browser then uses that number to connect to the website.</li>
<li><strong>You get curious and use WHOIS:</strong> You wonder, "Who actually owns <code>example.com</code>?" You go to a WHOIS lookup website (like whois.icann.org), type in the domain, and it tells you the registration company, when it was created, and when it will expire.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>In a Nutshell:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>DNS is for computers</strong> to find websites. It's about <strong>location</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>WHOIS is for people</strong> to find out about website owners. It's about <strong>ownership</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They work together to make the internet function, but they serve two completely different purposes.</p>
