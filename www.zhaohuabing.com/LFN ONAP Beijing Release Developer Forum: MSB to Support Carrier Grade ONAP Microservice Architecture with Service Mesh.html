<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this session, I'll talk about the MSB Plan for R2 and Beyond. I'll also discuss the OMSA(ONAP Microservice Architecture): the vision of ONAP Microservice Architecture to support Carrier-Grade requirements of ONAP Microservices, which includes Service Orchestration, Service Discovery, Inter-service Communication, Service Governance and Service Monitoring and External API Gateway.</p>
<p>ONAP Architecture Principle:  ONAP modules should be designed as microservices: service-based with clear, concise function addressed by each service with loose coupling.</p>
<p>MSB Plan for R2 and Beyond:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stability and Reliability: Reliable communication with retries and circuit breaker</li>
<li>Security: Secured communication with TLS</li>
<li>Performance: Latency aware load balancing with warm cache</li>
<li>Observability: Metrics measurement and distributed tracing without instrumentingapplication</li>
<li>Manageability: Routing rule and rate limiting enforcement</li>
<li>Testability: Fault injection to test resilienceof ONAP</li>
</ul>
