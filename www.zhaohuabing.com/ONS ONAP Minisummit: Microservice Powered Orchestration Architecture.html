<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this session, I'll talk about the MSB(Microservice BUS) project we have been using in OPEN-O as the fabric for Microservice communications.</p>
<p>First, I will start with why we choose Microservice Architecture in OPEN-O.</p>
<p>Then, I’d like to talk about the challenges we were facing when we turn to the microservice approach.</p>
<p>Finally, How we address these challenges in OPEN-O with the help of Microservice BUS 
And what’s the potential benefit MSB could bring to ONAP.</p>
