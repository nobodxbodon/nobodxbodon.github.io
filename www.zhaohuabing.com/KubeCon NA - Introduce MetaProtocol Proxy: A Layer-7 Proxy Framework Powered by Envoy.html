<p>Even with Envoy's powerful filter extension mechanism, writing a proxy for none-http protocols from scratch can be challenging. MetaProtocol Proxy solves this by abstracting layer-7 proxy with a concept called metadata and providing a “batteries included” framework that includes common traffic management capabilities: load balancing, circuit breaker, routing, rate limiting, fault injection, observability, etc. To write a layer-7 proxy for a new protocol, the only thing you need to do is implementing the codec interface.</p>
