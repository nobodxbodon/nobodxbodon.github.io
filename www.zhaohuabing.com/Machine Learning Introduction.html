<h1>What is machine learning?</h1>
<p>Two definitions of machine learning are offered.</p>
<p>Arthur Samuel version: &lt;BR&gt;
A field of study that gives computers the ability to <em>learn without being explicitly programmed</em>.</p>
<p>Tom Mitchell version: &lt;BR&gt;
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.</p>
<p>Example: playing checkers.</p>
<p>E = the experience of playing many games of checkers</p>
<p>T = the task of playing checkers.</p>
<p>P = the probability that the program will win the next game.</p>
<h1>Machine learning algorithms</h1>
<p>In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervised learning</li>
<li>Unsupervised learning</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some others: Reinforcement learning, Recommender  system</p>
<h2>Supervised learning</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples, <em>for every example in the training data set, the correct answer is already given</em>.</p>
<p>There are two types of supervised learning problems:</p>
<h3>Regression problem</h3>
<p>In a regression problem, the supervised learning algorithm is trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that it is trying to map input variables to some continuous function.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

&lt;center&gt;House Price Prediction&lt;/center&gt;<h3>Classification problem</h3>
<p>In a classification problem, the supervised learning algorithm is instead trying to predict results within a discrete output, meaning that it is trying to map input variables to discrete categories.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.</p>

&lt;center&gt;Breast cancer prediction with one feature&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Breast cancer prediction with two features&lt;/center&gt;<h2>Unsupervised learning</h2>
