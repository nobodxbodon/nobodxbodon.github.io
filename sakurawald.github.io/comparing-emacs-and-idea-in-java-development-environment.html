<h1>Comparing the Emacs and Jetbrains Idea in Java Development environment.</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Emacs is a general purpose editor for all editing tasks, including Java. We configure the Emacs using <code>lsp-java</code> package with <code>jdtls server</code>.
The Jetbrains Idea is a feature-rich IDE for Java language.</p>
<h2>Why Emacs?</h2>
<p>Picking Emacs for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fully keyboard-driven development workflow. You can do window-switcting, buffer-swapping, cursor-jumping, mark-setting easily without a mouse.</li>
<li>Emacs has the best vi emulator named evil-mode, which is better than IdeaVim plugin in Jetbrains platform, and alternatives in vscode.</li>
<li>Fully customizable editor, the keymap in Emacs is easier and powerful, and it's also easy to compose a new command based on existing commands.</li>
<li>Has gradle project support, and it can integrate with lombok via adding a vmargs for jdtls server.</li>
</ol>
<p>The weakness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Emacs is single-threaded, the async IO performance is poor. This is noticable while sending a lsp completion request. (Solution: use <code>lsp-bridge</code> package.)</li>
<li>Emacs is usable for pure Java development environment, for a specific framework project, like Minecraft Mod Development, still lacking the framework-supporting package. It's usable, but not sweet like Jetbrains Idea. (Solution: write it yourself man!)</li>
<li>Some sweet features is missing, like grep a text over all 3rd jar files in building environment. The workaround is to download a copy of sources of your 3rd files. (Solution: use <code>lsp-treemacs</code> pakcage and write the other functions based on lsp protocol.)</li>
<li>Better indexing for symbols in 3rd libraries. The de-compiler failed to de-compile some class files, causing the goto-reference failed. (Solution: use <code>cfr</code> de-compiler instead of the default <code>fernflower</code>.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Emacs wins for context-switching, text editing experience. 
Jetbrain Idea wins for async IO, better xref, rich framework-specific extension support.</p>
