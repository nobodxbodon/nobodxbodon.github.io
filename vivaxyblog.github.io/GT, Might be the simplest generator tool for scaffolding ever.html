<p>GT, aka granturismo, also the generator tool, might be the simplest generator tool for scaffolding ever.</p>
<p>GT is for someone who suffered from yeoman. GT is easier to set up in scaffold and easier for users to generate the project from the scaffold.</p>
<p>In GT, we set up the scaffold projects as a git repository. Each time you create a project you're using the newest scaffold.</p>
<p>GT has a list of scaffolds, in which you can choose from to quickly set up your new projects.</p>
<p>GT will optimize your list to make your favorite scaffold much more easier to reach.</p>
<p>As for developer, who makes scaffold, you needs to upload your scaffold onto public git repository, set up <code>gt.js</code> in your scripts directory. You might need to provide access to your scaffold by http or https. This makes the users easier to clone from git.</p>
<p><code>gt.js</code> exports an init method, to copy or update scaffold files into generated project. The init method takes information from the GT client. See https://github.com/vivaxy/granturismo for more information.</p>
<p>I have already made 2 scaffolds.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vivaxy/gt-react-scaffold">vivaxy/gt-react-scaffold</a> react, redux, router...</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vivaxy/gt-front-end-scaffold">vivaxy/gt-front-end-scaffold</a> eslint...</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, a better tool for a better world.</p>
