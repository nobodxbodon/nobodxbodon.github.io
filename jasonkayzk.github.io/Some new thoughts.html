<h1><strong>Some new thoughts</strong></h1>
<p>Haven’t wrote blog for a very long time.</p>
<p>It’s not that i got nothing to write, but i didn’t know how to summarize the thing that i’ve done recently.</p>
<p>Actually, i’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/LearningOS">LearningOS</a> for a bunch of time, and did make progress (and to be honest, this can be a reason that convinced me to get back the Rust, instead of C++).</p>
<p>Another reason that i did not post new article is that i got the pityriasis rosea (i don’t know what it is actually) last month, and this disease drove me crazy at a time!</p>
<p>Anyway, my last post could be last month, literally! And you know, lots of staffs happened: Abe Shinzo got assassinated, the 710 event in ZhengZhou, Nancy went to TW and made cn pissed off, and i got three 0s(zero raise, zero promotion and zero rsu) in my career during the past year.</p>
<p>For me, I got locked down again at home dual to the COVID-19, but what really made me pissed off is that the unbehavior for our gov (<strong>truely disappointed</strong>), and we got no effective way to resist or even discussion is prohibited?! And ironically, the only <strong>behavior</strong> thing i’ve seen is that, the prohibition for us own citizens (Actually, they got expertise in this).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost forgot to mention that, recently i was invited to do an online stream sharing about the <strong>CoRoutine</strong>, and here is the resource:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>After a few days that calm down myself, i decided to <strong>try to avoid these messy staffs and do something that i truly wanted.</strong></p>
<p>So i started soving lc problems (again) seeking opportunities, and resuming to post articles with no latency.</p>
<p>And maybe do some caption translation works from YouTube to bilibili in my spare time, who knows~</p>
<p>Another funny story is that i seen the <a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/27119724/">joker</a> again, and began to listen the Jazz by Frank Sinatra (<strong>the greatest Jazz singer I've ever heard of!</strong>).</p>
<p>Also Joaquin Phoenix, you are the best!</p>
