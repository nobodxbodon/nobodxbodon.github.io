<h1><strong>Start a new phase in my life</strong></h1>
<p>Maybe you’ve already heard lots of news abort Shanghai which has been censored for many times.</p>
<p>Recently, i took some times reviewed my life, maybe this is the time to prepare running away from now on.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not that kinda patriot guy. Oppositely, I started thinking about going abroad like, more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>But for recent years, especially recent two years, all the media, propogenda and endless censor truely makes me sick.</p>
<p>I am wondering whether we can tell the truth?!</p>
<p>Ageing population, high property prices, 996, is there any one or any gv took care of this?</p>
<p>Then the last straw is the epidemic in ShangHai.(Can any gv be worse like this?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to think that ShangHai can be the last wise gv in cn, as least.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, this passage can be no point, but can be a annocement that:</p>
<p>from now on, i may use all English to memo and share passages.</p>
<p>And thank god, we citizens in cn can still express opinions via foreigner lang.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>無限のしんさということは少なくとも10年前に気づいてよかった。</p>
<p>Thankfully、自分の国で他の言語を使って正常に表現するできる。</p>
<p>At least、言語の面では外国人と同じFirst Classになった。</p>
