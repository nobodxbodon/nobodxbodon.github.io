<p>一时兴起的听写, 不保证对. 听了个开头 (然后看完了), Sam 的台词最容易听.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</p>
<h2>0~1:50</h2>
<p>Sam (Narrator): In the beginning of a journey, no one knows what to expect.</p>
<p>Doug: You have some <strong>drafty</strong> windows and the bathroom door sticks. But otherwise, it's okay. I'm proud of you.</p>
<p>Elsa: Your own place. I can't believe it. Look at you. You're so grown up. You could be twenty.</p>
<p>Sam (Narrator): Sure they might have a vague idea that the road ahead might be rough.</p>
<p>Doug: How are the smoke alarms? Are they up to date? Can never be sure for these old buildings.</p>
<p>Sam: Double checking the <strong>safety precaution</strong> was a whole section of my moving checklist. We have new smoke alarms, first-aid kits, and an axe.</p>
<p>Elsa: An axe?</p>
<p>Sam: In case of fire. It belongs to Zahid's uncle who was the first ever Indian lumberjack from Vermont. They call him the Maple Syrup Swami.</p>
<p>Elsa: An axe?</p>
<p>Sam (Narrator): But no one sets off on expedition thinking: in four months I'll have a crippling case of scurvy (坏血病), and be forced to eat a sled dog.</p>
<p>Elsa: And this is where you can sit when we talk on Facetime every night.</p>
<p>Sam: Every night?</p>
<p>Elsa: I <strong>talk myself down</strong> from three times a day. So that is my best and final offer.</p>
<p>Doug: You want us to <strong>stick around</strong> to help you to set up?</p>
<p>Sam: No, thank you. Edison's <strong>had a big day</strong>. We need quiet.</p>
<p>Elsa: Okay. You wanna <strong>hold on to</strong> these boxes just in case?</p>
<p>Sam: No. Why? You can throw them away. There is a dumpster (大垃圾桶) <strong>out front</strong>. It's green, and someone named Dogface painted their name on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A dumpster is a movable waste container designed to be brought and taken away by a special collection vehicle, or to a bin that a specially designed garbage truck lifts, empties into its hopper, and lowers, on the spot. The word is a generic trademark of <em>Dumpster</em>, an American brand name for a specific design.</p>

<p>Elsa: Okie doke.</p>
<p>Sam: You can go.</p>
<p>Elsa: You are not allowed to make fun of me for crying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elsa 讲得真的好快, ruaruarua 就过去了 orz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doug: Same to you.</p>
<p>Sam (Narrator): That's what makes the new beginning so exciting. You don't know what will happen util it's over.</p>
<h2>2:14~3:42</h2>
<p>Zahid: Here it comes.</p>
<p>Sam: Shh...</p>
<p>Zahid: I'm so excited.</p>
<p>Sam: Quite.</p>
<p>Zahid 吹喇叭</p>
<p>Sam: Loud.</p>
<p>Zahid: Sorry.</p>
<p>Sam (Narrator): Beginnings can be painful.</p>
<p>Zahid: But dude, twelve eight am.</p>
<p>Sam (Narrator): But that doesn't mean they're bad.</p>
<p>Sam: I did it. I've officially stayed in our new apartment later than I've ever stayed anywhere.</p>
<p>Paige: Did I miss it? Did I miss twelve eight?</p>
<p>Sam: No, you are here just <strong>in the nick of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Paige: Oh, god.</p>
<p>Zahid: You <strong>look pretty fly</strong> in that <strong>union suit</strong> Paige.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"to look fly" is slang that means "to look cool or attractive".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Piage: Oh thanks. [没听清楚] Sam, congratulations.</p>
<p>Sam: Thank you.</p>
<p>Paige: I brought you something. It's a money tree. It brings good luck and prosperity. I was thinking you could put it in your room at the spot right next to Edison's <strong>tank</strong>. It's great sun. It'll be the richest turtle in town.</p>
<p>Sam: Okay.</p>
<p>Paige; And it's an easy plant too. Just three quarters a cup of water every four days, and maybe some seaweed based plant food once a week, and just keep rotating of course.</p>
<p>Zahid: I'll help. I once had a plant survive for two months purely on Mountain Dew.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Paige: You know what? Never mind. I'll just come by and take care of it myself.</p>
<p>Sam: Good. I've got enough to do finishing all the items on my moving cheklist.</p>
<p>Zahid: Oh I'll take a few of those off your hand. Least I can do as a roomie for another woomie (?). I'll make a copy of the key for emergencies, and <strong>switch over</strong> the power, and give your mom a really big huge.</p>
<p>Sam: That's not on the list.</p>
<p>Zahid: I added it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>重读强调了 I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paige: You guys do good. This place has really nice <strong>vibes</strong>.</p>
<p>Sam: One hundred years ago, it was a slaughter hourse.</p>
