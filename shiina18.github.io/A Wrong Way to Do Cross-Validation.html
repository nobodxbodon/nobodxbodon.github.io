<p>Consider a classification problem with a large number of predictors, as may arise, for example, in genomic or proteomic applications. A typical strategy for analysis might be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screen the predictors: find a subset of "good" predictors that show fairly strong (univariate) correlation with the class labels.</li>
<li>Using just this subset of predictors, build a multivariate classifier.</li>
<li>Use cross-validation to estimate the unknown tuning parameters and to estimate the prediction error of the final model.</li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</p>
<p>Is this a correct application of cross-validation? Consider a scenario with $N = 50$ samples in two equal-sized classes, and $p = 5000$ quantitative predictors (standard Gaussian) that are independent of the class labels. The true (test) error rate of any classifier is 50%. We carried out the above recipe, choosing in step (1) the 100 predictors having highest correlation with the class labels, and then using a 1-nearest neighbor classifier, based on just these 100 predictors, in step (2). Over 50 simulations from this setting, the average CV error rate was 3%. This is far lower than the true error rate of 50%.</p>
<p>What has happened? The problem is that the predictors have an unfair advantage, as they were chosen in step (1) on the basis of <em>all of the samples</em>. Leaving samples out after the variables have been selected does not correctly mimic the application of the classifier to a completely independent test set, since these predictors "have already seen" the left out samples.</p>
<p>Here is the correct way to carry out cross-validation in this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Divide the samples into $K$ cross-validation folds (groups) at random.</li>
<li>For each fold $k = 1, 2, . . . , K$</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) Find a subset of "good" predictors that show fairly strong (univariate) correlation with the class labels, using all of the samples except those in fold $k$.</p>
<p>(b) Using just this subset of predictors, build a multivariate classifier, using all of the samples except those in fold $k$.</p>
<p>(c) Use the classifier to predict the class labels for the samples in fold $k$.</p>
<p>In general, with a multistep modeling procedure, cross-validation must be applied to the entire sequence of modeling steps. In particular, samples must be "left out" before any selection or filtering steps are applied. There is one qualification: initial unsupervised screening steps can be done before samples are left out. For example, we could select the 1000 predictors with highest variance across all 50 samples, before starting cross-validation. Since this filtering does not involve the class labels, it does not give the predictors an unfair advantage.</p>
