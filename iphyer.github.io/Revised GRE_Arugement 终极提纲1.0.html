<h1>说明</h1>
<p>重新写了新的版本，基本可以说是1.0版本了。</p>
<p>原来的版本是word，先把word转成html，再用pandoc把html转成ocotpress支持的markdown。</p>
<p>这个过程肯定有不合理的，请直接下载pdf版本。</p>

<h1>前言</h1>
<h2>说明：</h2>
<p>题目序号参照ETS网站顺序，网址为：<a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool">http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool</a>，访问时间是2012.7.9,20:22。
参考了来自老G的《GRE
Argument终极提纲》以及《新GRE写作5.5》，《新老GRE题号对比argument》，一并致谢。有的地方注明了中文，考试的时候可以直接使用首字母代替。
文章采用Markdown语法，利用ReText2.1.6和chrome中MADE MARKDOWN
EDITOR插件的在Ubuntu12.04LTS和Windows XP平台下写成。</p>
<p>利用《新GRE写作5.5》中的分类方法进行了题库归类，归类的原则为：题干相同或者相似的题目归类在一起，这样Argument的174道题目中，133道可以归类为44组，再加上总共有41道无法归类的题目，所以压缩后的分类为85类。每一类，都有相同或相似的提干，比如No.3和No.171都是关于是否要取消滑板的问题，问题的direction是一样，但是题干的角度完全不同。同样的事情从不同的角度提问，请体会具体的区别，或者用工具高亮出不同的表述带来的不同.个人感觉，ETS在相近的提干表达中就自动表述出不同题目的具体的逻辑漏洞区别，请仔细比较第5，159，173这三题关于accidents
number的定语，从没有细说，到annual，到summertime都有表述，ETS就是在细节上体现区别。</p>
<p>建议准备的时候务必安排好针对questions，assumptions和evidence不同角度的自我模板。这样可以方便的写出自己的文章。同时对照OG和以前的范文修改。范文是唯一ETS认证的东西。</p>

<h2>1.0版本序言</h2>
<p>这是我重新捡起这个文档的时候，看看自己写的东西，微微一笑，或已忘言吧。</p>
<p>关于GRE的作文其实没有什么好说的了，作文这个东西，就是思想+语言。前者个人修养有很大的影响，但是对于Argument其实看看提纲也就够了。后者尤其依靠积累，这个帮不了大家，唯有多写多练才能有用。</p>
<p>最后的一点就是GRE的Argument其实不难，它的很多结构都是类似于“在NJU的男生需要每个月放几天假。因为根据THU的教师调查PKU的女生同胞每个月都有几天身体不舒服。同时通过对于过去十年THU老师的上课调查情况，每个月都有那么几个THU的男生不来。所以NJU的男生需要每个月放假几天。”</p>
<p>这个其实。。。你懂得，不需要很多的思维的。在这80几类里面随便挑个20~30个练练即可。事实上，我自己在写的时候就有一种ETS这是在玩人啊的感觉。</p>
<p>好了下面讲讲写这个感想吧。</p>
<p>想起刚刚过去的2012年，真是一部巨大的悲剧和喜剧。</p>
<p>在内心的深处，我希望大家都问问自己， 出国这条路上你走的可好？</p>
<p>你是不是还想起自己的父母，想起自己那个或许卑微，或许简单，或许宏伟，或许瑰丽，或许让你彻夜难眠，或许让你放弃了很多的出国梦想么？或许因为这样那样的原因你放弃了出国，这个没什么，人生很长，世界很广，中国很大，没有什么必须和一定，你大可以从头再来。只要你自己不熄灭你自己的梦想火焰，其实什么时候都可以重新开始。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>写完这篇文章我特别想告诉去年8月份我答应同学写完的同学，曾经我想这篇文章是写不完的。但是现在当我写完的时候，我才发现我离那个结果是多么近！！！是多么容易就可以达到，其实今天我就写了6个小时也就写完了。曾经我以为这个是无法写完的。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p><strong>真的，很多时候都是你自己给自己设置的陷阱。而不是生活本身。坚持着走下去。不要放弃。</strong></p>
<p>无论如何，生命还要继续。或许很多人都不喜欢你现在的选择。其实这个问题非常简单就是两个问题的纠结。你是不是可以改变你的现状呢？不能的话，那么就选择继续走下去吧。</p>
<p>最近看了，邓楠的回忆录。印象最最深刻的就是邓公当年的那句话——</p>
<p>“<strong>有的机会抓不住，对不起子孙后代！”</strong></p>
<p>忽然自己仔细回想了一下，突然觉得其实还是不要这么成功学的好。毕竟这个世界上很多都是我们自己去体会才能深刻了解的。修改这篇文档的时候突然想起来，这篇序言有没有必要写。</p>
<p>在心情低落的时候又一次看了《大唐双龙传》，这是我最最欣赏的书。虽然徐子陵，寇仲可能有开了主角光环的原因，但是两个人的感受无疑是对于我们自己最好激励。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>看看寇仲的思考吧：</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>事实上，他永远无法回到过去。也不可能凭思忆追回过去的岁月，更不能改变已成既往的选择和错误。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>失去的就是失去了，时间是一股永不回转的洪流。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>他已失去很多珍贵的东西，人总会不断犯错，作出不适当的选择，然后在事后懊悔，这情况不断的重覆。彷佛中使他感到茫然和不知该何去何从。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>所有以前的努力和成就都像无关重要，搔不着心头痒处似的。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>他就那么半醉半醒的辗转反侧，想起过去所有的人和事，素素的错嫁香玉山，宋玉致的爱恨交缠，与李靖的反目，商秀洵的负气而离去，各种情绪涌上心头，惭愧、自责、悔恨此起彼继的袭至，最终是感到无比的孤寂。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>这或是争天下必须付出的代价吧！</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>人生便是不断的争取，管他到头来是痛苦还是快乐。</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>其实更多是写给自己看的——</p>
<p>你欺骗不了自己，不喜欢就是不喜欢，这个不要用各种理由把自己都骗过了。这样才是人生的悲剧。</p>
<p>要敢于去冒险，有的问题是糊弄不过去的。得过且过的终会死的很惨。</p>
<p>人生积极点总是没有坏处的，自己控制不了自己才会完蛋。</p>
<p>最后，有手有脚饿不死人，为什么不敢去选，为什么不敢去做，为什么不敢去追求自己的梦想？如果你认为它还是梦想的话，不去做永远只是梦吧。</p>
<p>最后还是说说感谢：</p>
<p>感谢亲爱的爸爸妈妈，你们是我永远的支持。</p>
<p>感谢那些爱我的人和支持我的，我知道这半个学期我的情绪非常失控，但是你们一直支持着我。</p>
<p>祝福你们！</p>
<p>在这个即将迎来的壬辰年的末尾，祝大家在癸巳年更上一层楼，实现自己的理想。</p>
<p>谢谢《Word排版的艺术》的作者侯捷，这里的文章就是在他的文章启发下修改的格式比当时的beta版本好得太多了。其实Word的排版确实也可以接受，特别是不需要很多公式的时候。</p>

<h2>1</h2>
<p>Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have
previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric
village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by
the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a
"Palean" basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from
Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans
could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found.
Thus it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely
Palean.</p>
<p>Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed
to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or
strengthen the argument.</p>
<p>论点：so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.</p>
<p>论据:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Brim River is deep and broad</p>
</li>
<li><p>the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat</p>
</li>
<li><p>no Palean boats have been found</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>提纲：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Need evidence to show that in Palean times, the Brim River should be
as deep and broad.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Need evidence to prove that the Palean people have no ability to
make boat and other means like canoe to across the Brim River in
Palean times. Also should rule out the possiblity that the Lithos
people have the ability to cross the river or using boats possessed
by other culture.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Need evidenve to prove that the possibility that the Paleans may
arrived in Lithos through other means like trade, or the baskets
were carried to the Lithos by flood.</p>
</li>

<p>The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a scientific
journal.</p>
<p>"A recent study of eighteen rhesus (恒河猴) monkeys provides clues as to
the effects of birth order on an individual's levels of stimulation. The
study showed that in stimulating situations (such as an encounter with
an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as
much of the hormone (激素) cortisol (皮质素) , which primes the body for
increased activity levels, as do their younger siblings. Firstborn
humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating
situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence). The study
also found that during pregnancy, first-time mother monkeys had higher
levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring."</p>
<p>Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative
explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how
your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the
argument.</p>
<p>论点：The birth order can affect an individual's levels of stimulation</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>提纲：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The common characteristic of firstborn infant monkeys, Firstborn
human and first-time mother monkey can be the reason accounts for
the phenomanenon.They are both primates so when the urgent situation
is coming, they will react with hgiher hormone cortisol. So it is
instead of the birth order but they are all primates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another explanation is the ability of producing hormone cortisol
maybe related to ages. for those too young or too old is hard to
produce hormone cortisol</p>
</li>
<li><p>also this is only a case study and 18 rhesus monkeys maybe special
and can't represent the whole rhesus monkeys.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Still if producing hormone cortisol is just a reaction to some
extreme emotion like fear or anxiety and we cann't related it with
birth order.</p>

<p>The following appeared as a letter to the editor from a Central Plaza
store owner.</p>
<p>"Over the past two years, the number of shoppers in Central Plaza has
been steadily decreasing while the popularity of skateboarding has
increased dramatically. Many Central Plaza store owners believe that the
decrease in their business is due to the number of skateboard users in
the plaza. There has also been a dramatic increase in the amount of

city prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. If skateboarding is
prohibited here, we predict that business in Central Plaza will return

<p>The following appeared as a letter to the editor from the owner of a
skate shop in Central Plaza.</p>
<p>"Two years ago the city voted to prohibit skateboarding in Central
Plaza. They claimed that skateboard users were responsible for the
litter and vandalism that were keeping other visitors from coming to the
plaza. In the past two years, however, there has only been a small
increase in the number of visitors to Central Plaza, and litter and
vandalism are still problematic. Skateboarding is permitted in Monroe
Park, however, and there is no problem with litter or vandalism there.
In order to restore Central Plaza to its former glory, then, we
recommend that the city lift its prohibition on skateboarding in the

third-party obseveration should be introduced to judge whether it is
a small increase and problematic. Moreover all those vague statement
should be specific.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q2: Is it useful to lift the prohibition. If all the statements to

<p>The following appeared in a letter from a homeowner to a friend.</p>
<p>"Of the two leading real estate firms in our town—Adams Realty and Fitch
Realty—Adams Realty is clearly superior. Adams has 40 real estate
agents; in contrast, Fitch has 25, many of whom work only part-time.
Moreover, Adams' revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch
and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch's
$144,000. Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: ten years ago I
listed my home with Fitch, and it took more than four months to sell;
last year, when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took
only one month. Thus, if you want to sell your home quickly and at a
good price, you should use Adams Realty."</p>

assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends
on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if

Gazette.</p>
<p>"On Balmer Island, where mopeds serve as a popular form of
transportation, the population increases to 100,000 during the summer
months. To reduce the number of accidents involving mopeds and
pedestrians, the town council of Balmer Island should limit the number
of mopeds rented by the island's moped rental companies from 50 per day
to 25 per day during the summer season. By limiting the number of
rentals, the town council will attain the 50 percent annual reduction in
moped accidents that was achieved last year on the neighboring island of
Seaville, when Seaville's town council enforced similar limits on moped
rentals."</p>

there are a rapid increase of population or the traffice sign system
is too bad, or the climate of summer in Balmer Island is hard for
mopeds.</p>

annual reduction in moped accidents ? for example, people have their
own mopeds or the number of moped accidents in summer is only a
small part of the annual accidents.</p>

there are a rapid increase of population or the traffice sign system
is too bad, or the climate of summer in Balmer Island is hard for
mopeds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q4: Is the limit of rental companies in summer useful the 50 percent
annual reduction in moped accidents ? for example, people have their
own mopeds or the number of moped accidents in summer is only a
small part of the annual accidents.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q5： forget if the traffic system now can accept the increasing
demand of people who uses mopeds now and whether along with the
reduction of mopeds there will be more pressure in traffic even
cause more accients.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q6: what percentage of mopeds in Balmer Island is rented by the six
companies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>173</h2>
<p>.The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Balmer Island
Gazette.</p>
<p>"The population on Balmer Island doubles during the summer months.
During the summer, then, the town council of Balmer Island should
decrease the maximum number of moped rentals allowed at each of the
island's six moped and bicycle rental companies from 50 per day to 30
per day. This will significantly reduce the number of summertime
accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians. The neighboring island of
Torseau actually saw a 50 percent reduction in moped accidents last year
when Torseau's town council enforced similar limits on moped rentals. To
help reduce moped accidents, therefore, we should also enforce these
limitations during the summer months."</p>
<p>Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated
assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends
on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if
the assumptions prove unwarranted.</p>

<p>Arctic deer live on islands in Canada's arctic regions. They search for
food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of the
year. Their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the
plants on which they feed and cold enough, at least some of the year,
for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands, allowing the deer
to travel over it. Unfortunately, according to reports from local
hunters, the deer populations are declining. Since these reports
coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice
to melt, we can conclude that the purported decline in deer populations
is the result of the deer's being unable to follow their age-old
migration patterns across the frozen sea.</p>
<p>Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed
to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or

<p>The following is a recommendation from the Board of Directors of Monarch
Books.</p>
<p>"We recommend that Monarch Books open a café in its store. Monarch,
having been in business at the same location for more than twenty years,
has a large customer base because it is known for its wide selection of
books on all subjects. Clearly, opening the café would attract more
customers. Space could be made for the café by discontinuing the
children's book section, which will probably become less popular given
that the most recent national census indicated a significant decline in
the percentage of the population under age ten. Opening a café will
allow Monarch to attract more customers and better compete with Regal
Books, which recently opened its own café."</p>
<p>Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be
answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have
the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these
questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>提纲：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Q1:Are the two bookstores comparable at every aspect? Maybe Regal
Books uses café store to compensate the low income of their book
selling, in this case, Monarch can ignore the opening of a new book
store. Still we can question the effectiveness in attracting
csutomers?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q2: Is it appropriate to use children's book section for the café
just for a suvery indicates that a significant decline in the
percentage of the population under age ten? A decline in the
percentage of the population under age ten doesn't mean the whole
unmber of children under age 10 is decreasing. Maybe it is due to
the qucik increse of population of adult like immigrant. Further
more, even the smaller population under 10 doesn't mean the less
profit from children books. The fewer number of children may get
more support from their parents and spend more money on children
books. Still the if the book price rises, we can not safely say the
profit of books will decrease.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q3: Use children books as café may hurt Monarch Books' reputation of
wide selection of books on all subjects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q4: Although Monarch, having been in business at the same location
for more than twenty years, this doesn't ensure that it has a large
customer base. Furthermore if it is known for its wide selection of
books on all subjects, we can not ensure that opening of a café can
still keep its unique characteristic. The noise and smell of café
may ruin the atomsphere of Monarch.</p>

<p>The following appeared in a memo from the director of student housing at
Buckingham College.</p>
<p>"To serve the housing needs of our students, Buckingham College should
build a number of new dormitories. Buckingham's enrollment is growing
and, based on current trends, will double over the next 50 years, thus
making existing dormitory space inadequate. Moreover, the average rent
for an apartment in our town has risen in recent years. Consequently,
students will find it increasingly difficult to afford off-campus
housing. Finally, attractive new dormitories would make prospective
students more likely to enroll at Buckingham."</p>

<li><p>Evidence1: the trends of increasing enrollment will continue in the
future. He will need to proivde the data of other universities or
the enrollement number of Buckingham last few years. In deed, the
enrollment number will double over the next 50 years is really a
very small grow every year. In contrast, we can get the number
doubled over 5 years if the year growth rate is 9 percent. (the
exact growth rate every year is 0.01395948 if you consider one year
two enrollment it will be 0.00695555) So we need more evidence to
judge whether it is a large growth and better illustrate that
current dormitories in Buckingham could not meet students’ housing
needs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evidence2: we should prove that the rent for off-campus apartment
will continue to increase in the following years. Moreover, the
average rent for an apartment in our town has risen doesn't mean all
the rent for apartment will rise. For university students, the rise
of rent in top level will not affect their lives.</p>

<li><p>Evidence3: The author should prove that the rise of the house rent
is a long-term phonomenon and we can pridcit the long time trend of
rent.</p>

<li><p>Evidence4: We should rule out the possiblity that along with the
rise of the rent the economic situation of students will also be
risen. In this case, giving aid to those students from poor family
will be more effective.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island
of Tertia. Using an observation-centered approach to studying Tertian
culture, he concluded from his observations that children in Tertia were
reared by an entire village rather than by their own biological parents.
Recently another anthropologist, Dr. Karp, visited the group of islands
that includes Tertia and used the interview-centered method to study
child-rearing practices. In the interviews that Dr. Karp conducted with
children living in this group of islands, the children spent much more
time talking about their biological parents than about other adults in
the village. Dr. Karp decided that Dr. Field's conclusion about Tertian
village culture must be invalid. Some anthropologists recommend that to
obtain accurate information on Tertian child-rearing practices, future
research on the subject should be conducted via the interview-centered
method.</p>

<li><p>Twenty years ago, Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the
island of Tertia. Using an observation-centered approach to studying
Tertian culture, he concluded from his observations that children in
Tertia were reared by an entire village rather than by their own

<p>The council of Maple County, concerned about the county's becoming
overdeveloped, is debating a proposed measure that would prevent the
development of existing farmland in the county. But the council is also
concerned that such a restriction, by limiting the supply of new
housing, could lead to significant increases in the price of housing in
the county. Proponents of the measure note that Chestnut County
established a similar measure ten years ago, and its housing prices have
increased only modestly since. However, opponents of the measure note
that Pine County adopted restrictions on the development of new
residential housing fifteen years ago, and its housing prices have since
more than doubled. The council currently predicts that the proposed
measure, if passed, will result in a significant increase in housing
prices in Maple County.</p>

<p>In an attempt to improve highway safety, Prunty County last year lowered
its speed limit from 55 to 45 miles per hour on all county highways. But
this effort has failed: the number of accidents has not decreased, and,
based on reports by the highway patrol, many drivers are exceeding the
speed limit. Prunty County should instead undertake the same kind of
road improvement project that Butler County completed five years ago:
increasing lane widths, resurfacing rough highways, and improving
visibility at dangerous intersections. Today, major Butler County roads
still have a 55 mph speed limit, yet there were 25 percent fewer

<p>The following appeared in a memorandum from the manager of WWAC radio
station.</p>
<p>"WWAC must change from its current rock-music format because the number
of listeners has been declining, even though the population in our
listening area has been growing. The population growth has resulted
mainly from people moving to our area after their retirement, and we
must make listeners of these new residents. But they seem to have
limited interest in music: several local stores selling recorded music
have recently closed. Therefore, just changing to another kind of music
is not going to increase our audience. Instead, we should adopt a
news-and-talk format, a form of radio that is increasingly popular in
our area."</p>

大部分观众的电话都是关于天气预报减少的这一事实。因为，观众抱怨节目不一定代表是因为节目时间减少，也有可能是节目质量太差，报道不准确这些。The

<p>According to a recent report, cheating among college and university
students is on the rise. However, Groveton College has successfully
reduced student cheating by adopting an honor code, which calls for
students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify
a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated. Groveton's
honor code replaced a system in which teachers closely monitored
students; under that system, teachers reported an average of thirty
cases of cheating per year. In the first year the honor code was in
place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later,
this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a
majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to
cheat with an honor code in place than without. Thus, all colleges and
universities should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton's in order to
decrease cheating among students.</p>

assumes that Groveton stu­dents are just as capable of detecting

likely to report cheating whenever they observe it. In addition,The
author fails to investigate the number of cases of cheating which
were not reported.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q2：Other factors could also explain the decreasing number of cases

</li>
<li><p>Q5：推广到其他高校，但是这个类推是不是正确合理？如果其他高校作弊并不是很严重，甚至没有是不是必须采用这种措施？同时，其他高校学生作弊的原因是不是和Groveton一样？不一样的话，Groveton做法的效用就值得仔细考量。The
honor code may not be as same effective at other colleges and
universities as it was at Grovetown.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q6：The author fails to illustrate that the number of cases of
cheating at Groveton would be higher if we did not adopt the honor
code.
如果不采用这样的方法是不是作弊人数就会上升呢？如果随着社会教育的提高，可能学生整体素质在提高。</p>

<li><p>E2：这个数据只是说last year's birthrate was only one-half that of
five years

</li>
<li><p>E3：即使出生率确实下降，也不见得the number of students enrolled in
our public schools will soon decrease dramatically, andthe adult
population of the city to
increase。首先去年出生率下降，如果以6岁为开始上学的年龄那么至少6年后入学人数才会下降。其次，出生率下降，不一定就带来成年人人口数目的增加。虽然有可能使得成人的人口比例上升。同时无法保证未来会有其他的情况，比如疾病，移民，老年人口的死亡等，导致成年人数量下降。</p>

<p>The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside
Towers apartment complex to its manager.</p>
<p>"One month ago, all the showerheads in the first three buildings of the
Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to
one-third of what it used to be. Although actual readings of water usage
before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will
obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation,
since the corporation must pay for water each month. Except for a few
complaints about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been
reported since the adjustment. I predict that modifying showerheads to
restrict water flow throughout all twelve buildings in the Sunnyside
Towers complex will increase our profits even more dramatically."</p>

一个月的情况是不是可以代表全年，比如冬天的洗澡频率低于夏天。同时如果他们选择去公共浴室的话，那么数据更加不可靠。</p>

<li><p>作者同时有一个假设就是这前面三栋用户可以代表后面的所有用户。这三栋楼具有足够的代表性所以可以把在这些楼的做法向所有12栋推广。但是这三栋居民的人数，沐浴习惯可以代表全体住户么？3.
Without any actual readings of water usage before and after the
adjustment we cannot evaluate if the modification could actually
save
water.比如住户延长了洗澡时间，那么很难判断用水量的多少。同时，我们必须知道更换showerheads的话费和公司在水费上支持的大小，如果公司的水费开支极小的话，那么所谓的可以节省大量资金就不成立。</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fact that a few people complained about water pressure does not
necessarily indicate that all other clients are satisfied with the
modification.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The owner hastily assumes that the restricting on water flow could
be successfully carried out to all otherbuildings of Sunnyside
Tower. 比如他们会不会搬走，或者因为水太小而私自改装 showerheads 。</p>

<li><p>E2：The fact that people in East Meria rarely visit doctor for the
treatment of colds does not indicate a low incidence of colds.
还要证明他们不是对于感冒这些小病不是自己在家治疗或者自我恢复的。其次不是因为感冒去看医生，是不是经常因为其他的原因去看医生呢？也就是说多食用鱼或者其他的什么的是不是会带来易患其他的疾病？这需要证据排除，或者给出就医情况的全面数据。</p>
</li>
<li><p>E3：The author fails to establish a causal relationship between high
level of fish consumption and the low incidence of cold in East
Meria. 即我们不明确是不是吃鱼带来的感冒少。或者East
Meria的居民生活方式更加健康，环境污染更少，更加注意锻炼休息，或者East
Meria人口结构更加年轻，生病的人数自然会少一些。</p>

<li><p>E4：The condition in East and West Meria may not be

actually caused by colds. 也就是 West Meria
的缺席现象是由于感冒引起的。而不仅仅是有可能用来搪塞的借口。</p>
</li>
<li><p>E5：同时作者需要说明eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent
colds中的a substantial amount of
fish是多少，多少条鱼算够，推荐用量是多少。鱼的烹饪方法是不是有影响？还有鱼的种类是不是有影响？</p>
</li>
<li><p>E6：Ichthaid may not have the same function in preventing colds as
has eating fish.作者对于论证说的是East
Meria居民吃鱼的好处，但是推荐的Ichthaid。即使Ichthaid是a nutritional
supplement derived from fish
oil，但是光是鱼油的提炼物会不会和鱼肉有什么不同？同时还需要给出每天的用量，这些用量是不是科学呢？是不是没有什么毒副作用呢？</p>

<li><p>E7：同时作者需要证明大家都可以负担这些营养品的费用。The author does
not inform us the cost, and any possible side effects of Ichtahaid.</p>

<p>Milk and dairy products are rich in vitamin D and calcium—substances
essential for building and maintaining bones. Many people therefore say
that a diet rich in dairy products can help prevent osteoporosis, a
disease that is linked to both environmental and genetic factors and
that causes the bones to weaken significantly with age. But a long-term
study of a large number of people found that those who consistently
consumed dairy products throughout the years of the study have a higher
rate of bone fractures than any other participants in the study. Since
bone fractures are symptomatic of osteoporosis, this study result shows
that a diet rich in dairy products may actually increase, rather than
decrease, the risk of osteoporosis.</p>

<li><p>同时必须指明recycled material—which includes paper, plastic, and

flowers—has now been proved effective. In a recent study, 30 volunteers
with chronic insomnia slept each night for three weeks on
lavender-scented pillows in a controlled room where their sleep was
monitored electronically. During the first week, volunteers continued to
take their usual sleeping medication. They slept soundly but wakened
feeling tired. At the beginning of the second week, the volunteers
discontinued their sleeping medication. During that week, they slept
less soundly than the previous week and felt even more tired. During the
third week, the volunteers slept longer and more soundly than in the
previous two weeks. Therefore, the study proves that lavender cures
insomnia within a short period of time.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>提纲：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>30 volunteers are too small a sample that can hardly be
representative. We do not have any detailed information about the 30
volunteers, e.g. the severity of their insomnia, their physique,
etc., thus we could not evaluate if they are representative. The
author does not inform us about the volunteers' sleep patterns prior
to the experiment. (</p>
</li>
<li><p>How soundly or long a person sleeps, or how tired a person feels
after sleep, is irrelevant to whether the person suffers from
insomnia. 同时我们无法从患者的反馈中客观设立soundly or long a person
sleeps的标准，这个怎么测量？</p>
</li>
<li><p>The study fails to inform us how the volunteers felt after sleep
during the third week, thus we could not evaluate the actual effect
of lavender flowers on sleep.
也就是说，前两周有效不代表第三周有效，说不定只是治标，或者两周有效，第三周反而更加严重了。</p>
</li>
<li><p>正确的实验设计必须含有对照组：The study should include another group
of people who do not sleep on such pillows as counterparts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Granted that the volunteer’s sleep was improved through the three
weeks, we cannot ensure it is the lavender that caused the result,
other factors could also account for the
improvement.比如心里暗示作用。</p>
</li>
<li><p>The author cannot hastily conclude that the volunteers’ insomnia has
been thoroughly cured without any follow-up studies.</p>

<li><p>The reliability of the recent survey is open to doubt, who
responded? The number of respondents?
被采访者是不是因为从众心理或者怕他人嘲笑而说谎？</p>
</li>
<li><p>政府的健康计划也需要更多的证据支持The government nutritional
recommendations do not necessarily represent standards of healthy
lifestyles
。因为说不定政府的计划只是为了保证每个人的营养吸收设立了最低标准。同时The
government nutritional recommendations may have changed during the
past decade. 所以10年前的计划和10年后的计划是不是可以对比呢？</p>
</li>
<li><p>The increase in sales of food products containing kiran does not
necessarily indicate that the citizens are leading healthier lives,
people may purchase these food products for other
reasons.比如经济下滑，人们不得不吃含着个营养素的便宜食物。同时，作者没有提供吃这些食物的是少数人还是多数人。如果是少数人买了很多那也不代表什么。其次，作者没有说明是不是有很多的移民进入，如果这样的话，销量确实会上升但是不代表居民使用的比例上升。所以事实上没有任何影响。至少需要其他营养食物的比如，含有Vitamin，Calcium，Unsaturated
Fatty
acid等食物的销量。如果他们销量增加20或者总量远远超过Kiran事实上，Kiran的作用也就被削弱了。</p>
</li>
<li><p>同时sulia, a food that few of the most healthy citizens regularly
eat。最健康的人很少吃不代表不健康。所以需要更多独立科研机构的权威数据论证。The
fact that few of the healthiest citizens regularly eat sulia does
not demonstrate that sulia is unhealthy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>减少sulia的食用量，也有可能是因为环境改变sulia的常量减少了。现在很难买到或者需要从别的地方进口，太贵了都是可能的原因。</p>
</li>
<li><p>作者文章中使用归纳推理的方法。说明居民饮食习惯健康了，从而推论他们的生活习惯更健康，这里错误假设了饮食习惯代表生活习惯。但是The
author ignores many other factors that could be used to evaluate if
people are having healthier lives.
比如这里的居民运动习惯如何？文娱活动多么？他们生活节奏怎么样？生态环境有没有污染。社会心态等等。</p>

<p>文章中使用了两个演绎推理：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>论据1的具体过程如下：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>大前提：如果人类导致灭绝，人类该有和此类动物密切接触的痕迹</p>

<li><p>The fact that no evidence showing significant contact between humans
and the mammals has been found does not sufficiently prove that
there was no any such contact at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even if humans had no significant contact with mammals, human
activities might cause negative effects on mammals in different
ways, thus human activities might have caused the species’
extinctions indirectly.

not sufficiently demonstrate that humans have not hunted those
mammals.骨头可能做其他用途了，比如扔到河里冲走了，或者祭祀烧掉了，埋掉了。</p>

<p>Humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands about 7,000 years ago, and within
3,000 years most of the large mammal species that had lived in the
forests of the Kaliko Islands were extinct. Previous archaeological
findings have suggested that early humans generally relied on both
fishing and hunting for food; since archaeologists have discovered
numerous sites in the Kaliko Islands where the bones of fish were
discarded, it is likely that the humans also hunted the mammals.
Furthermore, researchers have uncovered simple tools, such as stone
knives, that could be used for hunting. The only clear explanation is
that humans caused the extinction of the various mammal species through
excessive hunting.</p>

<p>A recent study reported that pet owners have longer, healthier lives on
average than do people who own no pets. Specifically, dog owners tend to
have a lower incidence of heart disease. In light of these findings,
Sherwood Hospital should form a partnership with Sherwood Animal Shelter

ownership for patients recovering from heart disease, which should
reduce these patients' chance of experiencing continuing heart problems

<p>论点：In light of these findings, Sherwood Hospital should form a

<p>论据：</p>
<ul>
<li>A recent study reported that pet owners have longer, healthier lives

tend to have a lower incidence of heart disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>\</p>

<li>The program would encourage dog ownership for patients recovering

</ul>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>As a further benefit, the publicity about the program would
encourage more people to adopt pets from the shelter. And that will
reduce the incidence of heart disease in the general population.</li>
</ul>
<p>提纲：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>对于论据1，最最关键的就是研究的可靠程度。首先做这项研究的人必须是客观，可靠，中立的，不要是某个宠物饲料公司赞助的研究；其次研究的过程也必须科学，严谨，认真；最后研究的结果是不是被大家说普遍认可。简单说就是：可能No
causal relationship between owning pets and healthier lives of the
pet owners is established. OR Maybe, the author unfairly assumes
that at least a significant number of people who adopt pets from the
shelter will have risks of heart disease.</p>
</li>
<li><p>其次这项研究，事实上说的是养宠物的人更加长寿而不是养宠物可以改善病人的病情甚至治愈。那么对于已经患上疾病的病人，这个措施是值得怀疑的。也就是The
author fails to illustrate that owning a dog would have the same
positive effects on recovery of heart disease as it has on
preventing heart disease.</p>
</li>
<li><p>对于论据2，There may be other differences between people who own
pets and those who do
not.比如，养狗的人心态平和，愿意付出爱心等等也会影响心脏病的发病率。这些因素和养狗相关当事不是说养狗就能够带来的。换言之也可以不养狗而带来这些积极因素。对于动物的卫生免疫和清洁喂养都会带来问题，甚至寄生虫和传染病，所以其实这项计划说不定可能会有更坏的影响。Pets
could cause other health problems.最后，Some patients may not be
willing to adopt a dog, or capable of owning dogs, or could afford
raising a dog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>对于论据3，这个计划还是存在疑点。The author hastily assumes that the
proposed program would be appealing to the general
public.这需要很好的宣传效果和普遍人群都潜在着心脏病的风险才可能成立。Since
the risk of heart disease in the general population might be
influenced by many factors, implementing the program alone may not
sufficiently reduce the risk.</p>

<p>The following appeared in a memo from a vice president of a large,
highly diversified company.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>"Ten years ago our company had two new office buildings constructed as
regional headquarters for two regions. The buildings were erected by
different construction companies—Alpha and Zeta. Although the two
buildings had identical floor plans, the building constructed by Zeta
cost 30 percent more to build. However, that building's expenses for
maintenance last year were only half those of Alpha's. In addition, the
energy consumption of the Zeta building has been lower than that of the
Alpha building every year since its construction. Given these data, plus
the fact that Zeta has a stable workforce with little employee turnover,
we recommend using Zeta rather than Alpha for our new building project,
even though Alpha's bid promises lower construction costs."</p>
<p>\</p>

</ul>
<p>\</p>
<p>提纲：</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The vice president fails to consider many other differences between
the two regions and the two buildings.
比如这两个地方的环境对于房屋的折旧不同，这两地房屋的建设难度不同。</p>
</li>
<li><p>The low expenses for maintenance of the Zeta building last year
might be an unusual case, and do not necessarily continue in the
future.
这里只是提到了一年的数据，没有十年平均的结果。说不定十年的平均值反而显得Alpha更低？</p>
</li>
<li><p>同样的问题对于能耗这个数据。可能和Zeta所处的地区有关，比如这里冬暖夏凉，没有太大的温差变化。或者这里采用了更加先进的能源系统，比如地热等。其次人们对于能源的使用意识，是不是节能灯。同时，如果两栋大楼的使用率不一样的话也无法比较。</p>
</li>
<li><p>A stable workforce with little employee turnover tells nothing about
the construction quality of a construction company. The vice
president unfairly assumes that the working quality of Zeta is still
superior to that of Alpha
today.人员流动率低并不是一个很好的反应员工素质的指标，特别是单一指标的时候。比如可能是公司非常有前途而不愿离开，也可能是平均主义的考核制度，人员绩效考核低下等，或者大家特别懒惰等等。</p>
</li>
<li><p>所以，其实The facts cited by the vice president do not necessarily
indicate that Zeta has advantages over Alpha in constructing all
kinds of buildings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>最后不得不提到的一点是：The vice president fails to consider other
competent construction companies besides Alpha and
Zeta.特别是居然还在用十年前的公司书目情况来招标。难道这十年两家没有任何变化？</p>

<li><p>首先director的第一个论断是存在问题的。所谓大学的identity就不可以做任何的改变是让人存疑的一个证据。任何大学或者教育机构应当是顺应时代潮流，顺应社会需要。无视实际情况，抱残守缺是不是值得必要？当然有的特性也应当是坚持到底的，比如学术自由，科研诚信等等。继续深入论证的话全员女子教育是不是一所大学的本质属性呢？大学的目的，大学社会变迁中坚守与改变到底是什么呢？</p>

<li><p>关于新生的调查同样是值得怀疑的。比如调查的实施，调查者等。The
reliability of the survey is also open to doubt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>但是即使这样，也依然有问题，因为Students who favor all-female
education might be more likely to respond to the survey.
或者说其实选择这所学校的人本身就该是全员女子教育的支持者，这些学生很有可能是进入了这所学校而不得不说这所学校的好处。如果确实需要的话还要考察没有进入这所学校的同学是处于什么样的顾虑。</p>
</li>
<li><p>关于alumni的调查也是值得怀疑的。这里带入调查的N个理由。同时这里的信息其实存在着很多的问题。所谓alumni就是1
: a person who has attended or has graduated from a particular
school, college, or university 2 : a person who is a former member,
employee, contributor, or
inmate那么这些人的意见是不是具有代表性呢？是不是该问更多的人呢？比如家长，专业教育人事，政府官员，企业雇主，研究人员等。</p>

<p>The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a Batavia newspaper.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>"The department of agriculture in Batavia reports that the number of
dairy farms throughout the country is now 25 percent greater than it was
10 years ago. During this same time period, however, the price of milk
at the local Excello Food Market has increased from $1.50 to over
$3.00 per gallon. To prevent farmers from continuing to receive
excessive profits on an apparently increased supply of milk, the Batavia
government should begin to regulate retail milk prices. Such regulation
is necessary to ensure fair prices for consumers."</p>

<li><p>这里的第一个数据来自政府部门，所以我们还是基本接受的。但是更好的方法可以加入不同的相关机构去进行比较，更加佐证数据真实性。但是这个统计的问题在于没有给出更多的支持性数据。我们不知道牛奶厂数量增加是不是波动性的增加还是趋势性的持续增加。如果是波动性的数量增加，那么其实后续结果很难预料。The
number of dairy farms does not necessarily indicate the supply of
milk. 比如因为各种奶牛疾病或者新增加的奶牛场的管理问题等。</p>
</li>
<li><p>其次， We are not informed about how much did the price of milk
actually increase after adjustment for inflation.
也就是考虑到如果通货膨胀有80%的话，价格增加25%其实是可以接受的。</p>
</li>
<li><p>同时，这里存在着地域范围差异。The author unfairly assumes that
Excello's milk prices reflect those throughout Batavia.
或者也可以说，Even the production of milk in the country increased
in general, no information is offered to show whether the production
in Excello also increased.</p>

<li><p>The author fails to consider the variation in the demand of milk.
牛奶也有很多种的，不是每种都会涨价的。说不定只有一种涨价特别厉害，其他事实上在降价。</p>

<p>\</p>
<p>"Over 80 percent of the respondents to a recent survey indicated a
desire to reduce their intake of foods containing fats and cholesterol,
and today low-fat products abound in many food stores. Since many of the
food products currently marketed by Old Dairy Industries are high in fat

company profits will no doubt decrease. We therefore advise Old Dairy
stockholders to sell their shares, and other investors not to purchase

does not necessarily indicate an increasing demand for low-fat dairy

decline. 比如这类产品可能口感特别好，可能有特定的消费群体。</p>

<li><p>The argument fails to provide any information about other products
marketed by Old Dairy which may be low in fat and cholesterol.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The author fails to consider other factors that may influence the
consumers’ decision in choosing food.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The mere fact that many Old Dairy’s food products are high in fat

course and resort hotel. Since then, the Seaside Vista Tourism Board has
reported a 20% increase in visitors. In addition, local banks reported a

this year. The amount of tax money collected by Seaside Vista has also
increased, allowing the town to announce plans to improve Seaside
Vista's roads and bridges. We recommend building a similar golf course

<p>In a study of the reading habits of Waymarsh citizens conducted by the
University of Waymarsh, most respondents said they preferred literary
classics as reading material. However, a second study conducted by the
same researchers found that the type of book most frequently checked out
of each of the public libraries in Waymarsh was the mystery novel.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the respondents in the first study
had misrepresented their reading preferences.</p>

<p>The data from a survey of high school math and science teachers show
that in the district of Sanlee many of these teachers reported assigning
daily homework, whereas in the district of Marlee, most science and math
teachers reported assigning homework no more than two or three days per
week. Despite receiving less frequent homework assignments, Marlee
students earn better grades overall and are less likely to be required
to repeat a year of school than are students in Sanlee. These results
call into question the usefulness of frequent homework assignments. Most
likely the Marlee students have more time to concentrate on individual
assignments than do the Sanlee students who have homework every day.

<p>论点：Therefore teachers in our high schools should assign homework no
more than twice a week.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>论据：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The data from a survey of high school math and science teachers show
that in the district of Sanlee many of these teachers reported
assigning daily homework, whereas in the district of Marlee, most
science and math teachers reported assigning homework no more than
two or three days per week.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Despite receiving less frequent homework assignments, Marlee
students earn better grades overall and are less likely to be
required to repeat a year of school than are students in Sanlee.
These results call into question the usefulness of frequent homework
assignments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most likely the Marlee students have more time to concentrate on
individual assignments than do the Sanlee students who have homework
every day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>\</p>
<p>提纲：</p>
<p>此题的逻辑错误就是“<strong>在此之后，因此之故</strong>”。同时没有考虑横向类比的地区差异且盲目扩大条件使用范围，从自然科学想所有学科扩展。</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The result of the survey lacks credibility because many teachers in
other subjects were actually excluded from the survey.
同时调查者的背景，利益关系，是不是客观中立，都没有提供。</p>
</li>
<li><p>The author provides no information about the respective total amount
of homework assigned each time in Sanlee and Marlee.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The author fails to establish the causal relationship between
homework frequency and students’ performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many other differences between Sanlee and Marlee could explain the
differences in their students’ grades and likelihood to repeat a
year of school.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The students’ grades and likelihood to repeat a year of school are
not a good indication of the quality of education.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The two districts may not be representative of the state's school
districts overall.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The author fails to illustrate why we should assign homework no more
than twice a week, but not more or less.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The author ignores some negative effects of assign inadequate
homework.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The author unfairly assumes that any educational activity is
valuable only to the extent that it enhances overall grades.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>137</h2>
<p>While the Department of Education in the state of Attra recommends that
high school students be assigned homework every day, the data from a
recent statewide survey of high school math and science teachers give us
reason to question the usefulness of daily homework. In the district of
Sanlee, 86 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to
five times a week, whereas in the district of Marlee, less than 25
percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five times
a week. Yet the students in Marlee earn better grades overall and are
less likely to be required to repeat a year of school than are the
students in Sanlee. Therefore, all teachers in our high schools should
assign homework no more than twice a week.</p>

<p>Hospital statistics regarding people who go to the emergency room after

<li><p>数据来自医院而且是医院的急诊室，一般这里的病例都是比较紧急的外伤。也就是作者在统计数据的时候自然采用过了比较严重的roller-skating
accidents。大量的轻微伤害作者没有统计。同时不得不质疑作者数据来源的科学性和客观中立性，比如是不是受到药厂，急救样品厂的影响等。</p>
</li>
<li><p>75 percent of those who had accidents in streets or parking lots had
not been wearing any protective clothing or any light-reflecting
material这里其实作者犯了两件事物同时发生就是因果的逻辑错误。因为还有其他原因可能导致，比如停车场和大街比较拥挤，年轻人喜欢做刺激危险的动作，培训过少等等都会导致严重伤害。</p>
</li>
<li><p>结论要求大家investing in high-quality protective gear and reflective
equipment也有问题，这里他首先假设roller-skaters都受伤很严重；其次他假设这些设备可以保护；其次，他假设这些high-quality必须比普通的产品好上很多很多；然后还要假设没有其他因素可以带来保护。比如我可以更换滑雪场所等等。</p>
</li>
<li><p>同时他没有给出protective clothing (helmets, knee pads, etc.) 和
light-reflecting material (clip-on lights, glow-in-the-dark wrist
pads,
etc.)的区别，这样那些受伤的人群事实上可以被划分成好几种情况，是不是这些设别必须配合使用还是说只用一件即可。这些都会导致不同的防护效果。</p>
