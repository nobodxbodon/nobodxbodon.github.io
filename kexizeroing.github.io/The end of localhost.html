<h3>Why code in the cloud?</h3>
<p>Developers traditionally install and run tools like IDEs, libraries, and language runtimes on their local workstations. This approach makes sense at first, but has some downsides as an organization grows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone must carefully follow long setup instructions every time they work on a new project or get a new device.</li>
<li>Laptop processing power limits build speeds. Docker is fast on Linux but much slower on Mac.</li>
<li>Managing various versions of Python, Node.js, and others on the same laptop gets pretty risky.</li>
<li>Making local builds accessible to coworkers for testing takes significant time and effort.</li>
<li>Some required tools may only work on certain laptops.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gitpod</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/">https://www.gitpod.io/</a></p>
<p>From a Git Repository on GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket, Gitpod can spin up a server-side-dev-environment for you in seconds (prefixing its URL with <code>gitpod.io/#</code>). That's a docker container that you can fully customize and that includes your source code, git-Terminal, VS Code extensions, your IDE, etc. The dev environment is enough powerful to run your app and even side-services like databases.</p>
<p>This is easily repeatable and reproducible because it's automated and version-controlled and shared across the team. We call this dev-environment-as-code. Sending a snapshot of your dev environment to a colleague is as easy as sending a URL.</p>
<p>Your workplace is already compiled and all dependencies of your code have been downloaded. In order to tell Gitpod how to prepare a dev environment for your project, check in a <code>.gitpod.yml</code> file into the root of the repository.</p>
<h3>Brev.dev</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.brev.dev/">https://www.brev.dev/</a><br/>
<a href="https://console.brev.dev/">https://console.brev.dev/</a></p>
<p>Brev creates your powerful computer in the cloud for development. Brev solves configurations with the <code>.brev</code> directory. Create your <code>.brev/setup.sh</code> script to make your environment reproducible. Brev will automatically run it when creating the workspace.</p>
