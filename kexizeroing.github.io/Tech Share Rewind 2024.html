<p>Throughout 2024, I found myself sharing countless tech stories that caught my attention across different social media, primarily focusing on web development and AI - two areas I’m most passionate about. I've compiled these digital breadcrumbs month by month here, and hopefully I can keep this up every year.</p>
<h2>December</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This December, I took part in Advent of Code, Advent of TypeScript, and Debug December, all for the first time. It was an enriching and meaningful experience. My JavaScript solution to Advent of Code 2024 is <a href="https://github.com/kexiZeroing/advent-of-code-2024">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>BFCM highlights from Shopify Engineering. Every Black Friday Shopify shows how "boring" technology can be scaled just fine. This year they did 45M queries/sec with MySQL and somewhere around 1.3M request/sec on Rails.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try Gemini 2.0 Flash streaming live video. It's free. Give the demo at <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/live">https://aistudio.google.com/live</a> a go - it lets you stream video and audio directly to Gemini 2.0 Flash and get audio back, so you can have a real-time audio conversation about what you can see with the model.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Google just released Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, a new AI model that pauses to "think" through complex problems like OpenAI's o1 model, but is free-to-use and works faster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OpenAI Realtime API now supports WebRTC—you can add Realtime capabilities with just a handful of lines of code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next.js AI Chatbot 3.1. Editable artifacts/canvas UI for writing and code. Python code execution (via Pyodide and WASM).</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://t3.gg/blog/post/ssr-is-not-expensive">Debunking the Myth: SSR Isn't Expensive</a>. SSR costs are low, reduces other cloud costs, and provides a better experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A lot of people miss the real genius behind Bolt from Stackblitz. Yes, it's using AI to build apps, but even with powerful LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, none of it would be possible without Web Containers <em>(run Node.js directly in the browser)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19">React v19 is now stable</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ollama 0.5 is here with <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs">structured outputs</a>. This makes it possible to constrain a model’s output to a specific format defined by a JSON schema.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quickly turn a GitHub repository into text for LLMs with Gitingest. Replace "hub" with "ingest" in any GitHub URL for a text version of the codebase.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>Claude introduces the Model Context Protocol, which is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. There is a cool summary quickstart <a href="https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you need to interact with DOM nodes directly after they rendered, try not to jump to <code>useRef</code> + <code>useEffect</code> directly, but consider using callback refs instead. React will call your <code>ref</code> callback with the DOM node as the argument.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Wes Bos finds out about <code>display: contents</code>. This causes an element's children to appear as if they were direct children of the element's parent, ignoring the element itself. This can be useful when a wrapper element should be ignored when using CSS grid or similar layout techniques.</p>
