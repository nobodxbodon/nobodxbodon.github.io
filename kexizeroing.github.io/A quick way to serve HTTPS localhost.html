<p>As we all know HTTPS is designed to provide a secure connection by encrypting the data exchanged between a user's web browser and the server. Sometimes we need a secure connection for our Node.js web server. This article will help you understand how to do it.</p>
<h2>Certificates</h2>
<p>First, let's talk about certificates. A certificate is a digital document that serves to authenticate the identity of an entity on the internet. This entity could be a website, a server, or even an individual. The most common type of certificate used in web security is an SSL/TLS certificate, which is used for enabling HTTPS. Note that a SSL/TLS certificate typically contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Key: This is a cryptographic key that is used for encrypting data. It's part of a key pair, with the private key being securely stored on the server.</li>
<li>Identity Information: This includes details about the entity the certificate is issued to, such as the domain name of a website.</li>
<li>Digital Signature: The certificate is digitally signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA is a trusted third party that vouches for the authenticity of the information in the certificate. <em>(Examples of widely trusted CAs include DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, Comodo, and Symantec.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When a user's browser connects to a website over HTTPS, the following steps take place to verify the certificate:</p>
<ol>
<li>During the initial stages of the connection (SSL/TLS handshake), the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the client (browser).</li>
<li>The browser checks whether it trusts the CA that issued the certificate. Browsers come pre-installed with a list of trusted CAs. If the CA is trusted, the browser proceeds with the verification process.</li>
<li>SSL/TLS certificates can form a chain of trust. The server's certificate might be signed by an intermediate CA, and that intermediate CA's certificate is signed by a root CA.</li>
<li>Certificates have an expiration date. The browser checks if the certificate is still valid by comparing the current date with the certificate's expiration date.</li>
<li>The browser ensures that the domain name in the certificate matches the actual domain of the website to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
<li>If all checks pass, the browser and the server proceed to exchange encryption keys securely, and the encrypted communication begins.</li>
</ol>
<p>By going through these verification steps, the browser establishes trust in the authenticity of the website and the public key presented in the certificate.</p>
<p>Curious about the details in verifing the trust. For example, on a Mac, the list of pre-installed trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) is managed by the operating system. You can access and view this list through the Keychain Access application. You'll see a list of certificates, which may include both root certificates and intermediate certificates, as the trust chain often involves multiple levels of CAs.</p>
<h2>Create Self-Assigned Certificate</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a> is a tool that simplifies the process of setting up a local development environment with HTTPS. <code>mkcert</code> is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you use <code>mkcert</code> to generate a certificate for your local development server, it issues a certificate signed by the local CA. Since the local CA is added to the trust store on your machine, certificates signed by it are considered trusted for local development purposes.</li>
<li><code>mkcert</code> allows you to easily generate certificates for specific domain names, making it convenient for creating SSL/TLS certificates for your local development server with a custom domain.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">brew install mkcert

# Generate and install the local CA
mkcert -install

# Generate a certificate for your local development server.
# You can replace `example.com` with the actual domain you are using for local development.
# For instance, if your local server runs at `myapp.local`, you would use `mkcert myapp.local`.
mkcert example.com localhost
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that while this approach is useful for local development, when deploying a website to production, you would typically obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) that includes the actual domain used in production.</p>
<blockquote><p>To assign a name to your local IP address for local development, you can either modify the Hosts file or use something like <a href="https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started">ngrok</a> to put your application on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Integrate with Node.js</h2>
<p>Finally, let's combine the certificates we generated with the Node Express server.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem example.com localhost
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">import https from 'https';
import fs from 'fs';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.send('Hello, HTTPS World!');
});

// Load SSL/TLS certificates
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('key.pem', 'utf8');
const certificate = fs.readFileSync('cert.pem', 'utf8');
const credentials = { key: privateKey, cert: certificate };

// Create an HTTPS server
const server = https.createServer(credentials, app);

server.listen(port, () =&gt; {
  console.log(`Server running at https://localhost:${port}`);
});
</code></pre>
