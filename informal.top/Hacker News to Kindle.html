<h2>Why kindle is better</h2>
<p>I usualy read kindle on the bed before I fall asleep, I think the big advantage of reading kindle is that kindle leads less distractions. When I use computer and browser the website, it's so eary to do other think when a notification jump, like text messages app or gmail. In contrast, When I read on kindle, I only focus on kindle and nothing else.</p>
<p>In the past, I just readed books on kindle. But recently, I found that I can send weekly The Economist edition to kindle to read news. But the weekly update cannot meet my requirement, because my wife spend much more time on preparetion on falling asleep. I realize that I can send more news into kindle to read. It's a much better choice than reading on the computer or Phone.</p>
<h2>HN2Kindle</h2>
<p>The best choice is Hacker News, that is the most popular news source for tech. So, I build a project to send Hacker News contents to kindle.</p>
<p>I think kindle or books is definitely a better choice to obtain information than computer or Phone, it can lead less distractions and improve the efficiency. The problems of books and kindle were slow update, but it can be solved by thiry-party service. We can solve this problem as long as we can fine high-quality data, even AI generated contents.</p>
<h2>Disadvantage</h2>
<p>I just found a disadvantage of reading news in the evening, it makes me excited. As a result, it will be hard to fall asleep.</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter if you read it at day.</p>
<h2>Idea comes from new thing</h2>
<p>I usually have a new idea when I try something new, like finding out new idea about entrepreneurship, taking driving test, university ddl-alert, reading news on kindle. Most things I do are not my choice, but it doesn't matter, I can have a new idea when I do something new. So, I should try new thing in life when I have new idea.</p>
<p>Another method is mining demand from other people, like reddit, quora, that need more ability to simulate what others are experiencing, and it cost more time to fine the valuable ideas from the whole market.</p>
