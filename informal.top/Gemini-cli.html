<h2>Gemini-cli</h2>
<p>Gemini-cli is command line tool supported by Gemini-2.5-pro model, it's a similar product with Claude-code by Anthropic but free, what's more, Google open source all code of Gemini-cli in github and receive 20k stars in only one day, 40k in three days, this's scene that never happened for a long time.</p>
<p>I use Gemini-cli to generate a project which can transfer model from huggingface into modelscope, I need this feature for a long time. As a result, I complete this project in three hours, this make me suprise. Gemini-cli was good at search various api and to use them, which will consume much time for human.</p>
<p>Gemini-cli is strong for me because</p>
<ol>
<li>Add/delete/modify file in command, which create more space for llm to use their ability. </li>
<li>execute code and receive output after exectuing, iterate the code by executing on turn and another. </li>
<li>When meet name alreadly be used, it will change a new name to test it, and recover the name before finis the code, small but interesting design. </li>
</ol>
<p>Gemini-cli really spent so much tokens, shows the determination of Google on AI.</p>
<h2>hf-ms-transfer</h2>
<p>I'm unwilling to start a new project or update a existing project naturally, it's hard to start, but, it's eary to continue after starting. In my opinion, this is the difference between nature and maturation. This also happens on hf-ms-transfer project, even it's not hard to finish.</p>
<p>I think this is why many people always say that just do it rather than talk a lot, it's reasonable. it's everyone should overcome.</p>
