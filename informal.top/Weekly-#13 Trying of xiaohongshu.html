<p>It's hard to get regular flow, business transformation is also hard than expectation to obtain.</p>

<h2>Thought</h2>
<h3>replace cost</h3>
<p>replace cost is always high because I realize increased value can not meet the replaced cost for new product in most situations. NotebookLM is a typical sample, I thinks it's a geat product, but it definitely increased the cost.</p>
<p>replaced cost is always than expectation.</p>
<h3>Competitive programming</h3>
<p>start to participant some contest in codeforces this week, making me enjoyable. Coding really make me happy, especially for this kind of contest.</p>
<p>Instant feedback is the main reason, like <a href="https://github.com/cuixiaorui/earthworm">earthworm</a>, which is a instant-feeback english learning tool.</p>
