<h2>English proficiency</h2>
<p>I though I can improve my english ability after staying in english speaking country for some time naturally, this is definitely wrong. English proficiency can be imporved only when I practice it. Changing naturally is just the cover of true life.</p>
<p>Recently, I took two interviews, that's the direct event that I realize I still have huge disadvantages on english proficiency. First one is a basic english recorded-video interview, I just introduce myself and failed in that interview. Second is a coding interview for a project, the problem is reading for the materials, I read so slow, as a result, I don't have enough time for coding.</p>
<h2>How to improve</h2>
<p>When I was preparing the standard english test in the past, I use ChatGPT a lot. The most I used ChatGPT is for speaking, it has native speaking ability and talk with me all the time, talking is the more direct and efficient way to imporve speaking ability, talking is practicing for speaking. In addition, I also use ChatGPT to help me correct the sentences or essay I wrote, and use ChatGPT build some automatic tools for listening.</p>
<p>After I passed the exam, I use it less and less for learning english. I don't have the clear target for learning english now, so, I don't have a clear plan and assign dedicated time for learning english. As a result, I never use ChatGPT for learning english after that.</p>
<p>These thing doesn't influence the fact that ChatGPT is the best tool to help people learn english. Just like saying in The Almanack of Naval that I was reading recently, any opinions cannot influence facts, we should know what is really fact without influence of any kinds of emotions.</p>
<p>Back to orignal topic, for input end, we can just practice more listening and reading, there are so much materils we can use. For writing part, we also can practice by ourself and let ChatGPT to correct me for uncorrect spells and obvious grammar errors. For speaking part, I also can practice with ChatGPT, the correctness can be improved from writing, as a result, I can learn english all by myself without helps from others.</p>
<h2>Diffculty</h2>
<p>It's easy to execute with a clear plan, but I realise that I looked for some execuses to avoid the efforts I should put in learning english, this just like the old saying. This makes me have a more deep understanding that we need to recognise as much as fact in life, human are good at looking for execuse for what the do naturally.</p>
<p>Hope I can execute the plan well.</p>
