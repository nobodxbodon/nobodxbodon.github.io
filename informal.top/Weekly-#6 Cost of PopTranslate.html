<h2>title: Weekly-#6 Cost of PopTranslate</h2>
<h1>Product process</h1>
<h3>PopTranslate</h3>
<p>This is a multi stages story.</p>
<p>1) Lost my free $300 in Google Account</p>
<p>In order to join the YouTube Premium family account, I need to change my location from Canada to America. So, I delete my previous payment profile, which is used for Google Translation API but I didn't realize that at that time. I create a new payment where I set the address in America and linked this payment with Google Translation API in order to continue use it.</p>
<p>After two days, I realized I lost the free $300 for new account from Google and must pay billing by myself, it cost about $25 everyday and last two days, of course it's too expensive. This is also the first time I realized it's so expensive for Translation server.</p>
<p>I link my card with another Google account and use the free $300 to creat a new api_key and use it in PopTranslte new version, I published new version immediately.</p>
<p>This is almost the end of stage 1 and must pay about $50 in the end of the month.</p>
<p>2) Tranfer Translation from Google API to self hosted service.</p>
<p>After I pubslished PopTranslate two week, the data is already stable, it shows as below:</p>
<blockquote><p>active users: 18</p>
<p>change: $27.12</p>
<p>requests: 11k</p>
<p>average requests: 611</p>
<p>average characters per requests: 61</p>
<p>average QPS: 0.12</p>
<p>Google translation API price: $20/500k characters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of course it's too expensive even I make the extension paid for user. so, I must tranfer it to self hosted service.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate">LibreTranslate</a> is the best option I have found, I'm trying to hosted this on Google VM, but it always not a ideal option because VM cost $30 per month, I can use it at least 3 months because $300 from Google is valid in 90 days. I will find a better solution after that.</p>
<p>self-hosted is complex, I'm still trying.</p>
