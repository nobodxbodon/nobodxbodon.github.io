<h3>Project</h3>
<p>The last month goes fast, because I almost spned all my last month into a new project. Right now, I finish the first relative muture version of the project. Of course, I still realize some feature that I intended to implement later, I just cannot help myself to optimize that part when I was thinking of that.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the feeling that I put all myself into a thing that I'm total responsible and liked. Even I must pend the project because winter is coming, many thing in canada will stop in winter, outdoor activities becomes rare in winter. There is no enought clients for my new project.</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Yeah, I don't want to share more details about this project now, but I want to write relection about the project. The success of a project is very very hard, it will influeced by lots of reason, you can success only when you have the all requirements. Generally, the most important reason about a project is not you, or the most element that have largest influence for the project is not the people how participate the project, that maybe something you can not make decision, like economic trend, or governmental policy. But the owner of project should be responsible to indentify these crucial and necessay elements. For example, I should know that there are few or almost zero clients during winter season for my project, as a reuslt, I can spend less efforts that I've done in the project.</p>
<p>I also learn some great things from the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the entire service for users rather than half-service, clients prefer to purchase the entire product with high price voer half-service with low price. </li>
<li>Reaching out your target clients is the most hard part, don't be shy when you are readching out, do anything that can help you to reaching out the clients. </li>
<li>Publish the first experimental version as soon as possible, to get feedback ASAP and push the positive circle. I also learnt that publish the first muture version as late as possible from someone else, but I don't have opportunity to apply that in my project. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Influence in life</h3>
<p>I always put anything away when I have a great project to participate with, I'm happy during do the project. But after I failed and quitted the project, I lost so much thing. I need to meet the consequence resulting from my careless for my life, like the relationship with my partner, the poor assignments that I finished without enough care.</p>
<p>It happends a lot that a project failed in the end, I should balanace my life better when I meet my next project. More specificly, I should be more peaceful when I meet next great project, that can help me to counter the challenges in life.</p>
