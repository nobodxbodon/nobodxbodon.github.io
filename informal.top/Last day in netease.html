<p>Today is the last day for me in netease, I don't much as much feeling as that in baidu, on the one hand, I spend much more time in baidu, almose five days, one the other hand, that's my first job, first time is always different.</p>
<p>What makes my surprise is yesterday, the boss, all people in my small group have a bye-bye lunch, leader and boss are both friendly even I only stay here over four month. This is a friendly team, we don't have the rules of big tech company, like how to flattery for leaders, says some words what are needed but we don't want. In the middle of lunch conversation, we talked about the flattery atmostphere in baidu, what made me surprise is that some people think flattery issues is more serious than I thought. In the last moment, I suddenly remembered that we don't have a cheer up, so, I ask for one. Boss jokingly said that the ex-baiduer want a cheer in the end, I also realise that. Actually, it's usually not my job in the common dinner. What makes me unforgottable is freedom and flexibility in this netease team, we totally dont have to care the reporting relationship in daily works and chatting, which makes the atmosphere great, maybe perfect.</p>
<p>In the back road from restaurant to company, I was told much information about last era of Internet and companies in that time. There are much opportunities in that era, there are so much products they can do, some of them became totally successful. I always like the story of history, especially sounded from a person how experience by himself/herself, it's like Qin emperor teach me the history of Qin dynasty.</p>
