<p>This is a project tearch you how to use Triton, which is a new open-source alternative language for cuda. It's always hard to understand and use it if you are not familiar with cuda-type language.</p>
<p>This is definitly a great project for beginners, I thing every hard field should have this kind of toturial. Meanwhile it's not possible for every filed to have, it's luck for projects in computer science field.</p>

<h3>Enjoy life</h3>
<p>This Tuesday, This is my first time felt that I have much interest in much different thing.
First of all, I want to spent as much as time on table tennis, I played about average 3 hours everyday recently and enjoyed that so much. as a result, This’s the first time I felt knee pain due to the exercise, which prove I don’t have such much exercise in recent years. Secondly, After having a recoding video of Leetcode problem yesterday, I also want to do that again today, but I don’t have enough time, because I mush spent some time on triton, which is a new interesting project in LLM acceleration. Thirdly, after spending two hours on triton puzzles, I found some similarity between C++ and triton, which can totally control the most basic hardware. This trigger my interest, as least right now. Last but not least, after buying book thing explainer, which explain everything science products by simple words, also attract me a lot. Just like the economist, I like read this kinds of articles.</p>
<h3>Sociality</h3>
<p>I planed go to Canada next friday, So, I eta dinner with three groups of friends, talk a lot about life and feature. Everyone have differnet work, life and status. It's hard to say which is better. I thing hope is the most important thing all over the world, but there're still some presure for living. Working hard to pursure what I want can make my current life and experience more worthy.</p>
