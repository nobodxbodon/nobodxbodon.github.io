<h3>Triton</h3>
<p>Try to debug the Liger-Kernel but found it works well except bfloat type.</p>
<p>Learning news about LLM translation and try to realise the whole one in this kind of project, like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09009">cut cross entropy</a></p>
<h3>Glass</h3>
<p>My glass broke on 1.9, I'm really blind when I lost my glass. This is first experience I broke my glass and realise that how the backup of glass is important.</p>
<p>This is what I do next:</p>
<p>1) Buy the invisible glass, which is accessable immediately. I can use it untill I get a better option.</p>
<p>2) Buy one new in near store, the quality is maybe not well but practical. My degree of glass is really high, as a result, I can receive new glass after three days.</p>
<p>3) Buy a good one. I found a great <a href="https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=37194262&amp;rand=472">blog</a> about how to test degree of eyes and choose glass. So, I test eyes degree three times recently to get the accurate degree. I choose a brand of glass without fraud concerns and buy glass frame and lens online.</p>
<h3>English</h3>
<ul>
<li>Podcast: practical, I need to keep the routine of listening everyday.</li>
<li>Read and comment: more patience is necessary</li>
<li>Books: I cannot read much. </li>
</ul>
<p>I will try more about podcast and books in the next week.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It's essential to maintain a backup glass for high-degree person, even the invisible glass.</p>
