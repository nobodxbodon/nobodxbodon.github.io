<p>This is the second time period that I need to seek a job position in my life till now. I don't have much experience to take a interview in the past, I think I learn a lot this time.</p>
<p><strong>First lesson I learn</strong></p>
<p>Preparation is necessary for me to seek a better job than that in the past, not only for the project experience or basic knowledge, but also the attitude and future plan. I need to prepare for some dedicated time even not enough before the interview.</p>
<p><strong>Project experience</strong></p>
<p>Interview will let me know which project I have done is important and valuable, I should do that more in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Basic knowledge</strong></p>
<p>I will review all basic knowledge before interview, it's a opportunity to review all details or theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Future plan</strong></p>
<p>Failed interview let me know what I should learn in the future, This is a good way to get the new direction.</p>
