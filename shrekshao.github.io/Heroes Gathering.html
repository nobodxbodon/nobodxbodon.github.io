<p>&lt;b&gt;Hero Gathering (英雄集结号)&lt;/b&gt; is a project for the programming and algorithm class when I was freshman. Because of this,
to bring in as many technical elements as possible regardless if it's suitable (ODBC, Win32, flash, ...), it turns to
have a really wired structure and very hard to distribute. &lt;br/&gt;
The game idea itself is not bad though. Players gather
heroes like pokemons, and the turnbased battle has a special system similar to rock-paper-scissor which makes it possible
for zeros beat heroes. Even in 2015, I still spent a whole day just playing this game -_-!.</p>
