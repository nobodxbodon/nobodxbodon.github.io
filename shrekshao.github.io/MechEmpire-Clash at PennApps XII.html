<p>&lt;b&gt;MechEmpire-Clash&lt;/b&gt; is a multiplayer 3d shooting game, players can join the game and control their robots either
with their mobile device (with support of EA pathfinder API), or with classical mouse and keyboard.
&lt;br/&gt;
The ideas, models, and game background are adapted from MechEmpire. Basically I want to make this game an extension of MechEmpire
Series, which can include AI agents programmed by contestants in the future. I hope this game together with MechEmpire
can be continuously developed and help people learn programming happily.
