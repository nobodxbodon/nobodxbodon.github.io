<p>PennPlay 2016 with <strong>Kai</strong> and <strong>Ryan</strong>! An html + js lightweight strategy game (an experiement -_-) inspired by Conway's Game of Life. Based on canvaslife - Julian Pulgarin.
Players can evolve their species by upgrading them with claws, stings, fat, poison, etc... by spending gene mutation. Vairous attributes will affect the reproduce, live, competition and prey.
You can develop your species in the track of a herbivore, a carnivore, or plants that live on self generated energy!</p>
