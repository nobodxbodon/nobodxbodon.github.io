<p>I implement the glTF Avatar System in Three.js, with some improvement. It can also merge export the avatar as a single glb file, and loaded by any engine supporting glTF. I post it to Facebook 3D post as an example. A website as a sharing platform of skeleton and skin files is also under construction as a 肥宅快乐工程</p>
