<p>MechEmpire is an AI agent programming game, consisting of a Game Core, 2D(Flash)/3D(Unity) Game Renderers, a
Website with an Arena System, and Models and Designs of the mechs. Comparing to other programming games, it focuses
more on playability and game experience. A large variety of weapons and engines are available for different types of
tatics, which brings a lot of fun to the programming game.</p>
<p>I created MechEmpire from scratch in 2013. So far I have met some great teammates and we have succeed holding two Competition
Seasons, attracting students from Southeast University, UCLA, The University of Electronic Science and Technology of
China, and etc. MechEmpire has also been working as a registered SRTP competition in SEU. It is the greatest time of
my undergraduates working with these guys.</p>
