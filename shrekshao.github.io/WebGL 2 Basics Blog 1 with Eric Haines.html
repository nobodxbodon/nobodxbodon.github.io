<p>This is a tehnical blog co-authored with <strong>Eric Haines</strong>, introducing some basics about moving a WebGL 1 program to WebGL 2, posted on Eric's Real-Time Rendering Blog.</p>
<p>Being a person with very limited experience with writing an engine, I feel great pressure to write such a blog. 
But meanwhile being a shameless glory seeker, and treating this as a great opportunity to work with Eric, I give it a try. Hope you find it useful. 
And Great Thanks to all the authors I take a reference from.</p>
