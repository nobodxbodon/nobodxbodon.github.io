<p>In 2023 I spent most of my time on work, learning &lt;span style="background-color: var(--post-text-color)"&gt;and dating&lt;/span&gt;. Compared with the last year, devoted less time on this blog and community. It might be a pretext but to be honest, writing a blog post always consumes a lot of my energy, especially when there was a lot of overtime this year. Anyway, I should write more posts in the new year, and I'll try to write some non-technical posts (well, partially because they're easy to write (and read)).</p>
<p>Let's talk a little about professional skills over here. In the past, I focused most of my efforts on coding skill, rather than engineering skills, or let's say, the business skills. This is because I love the hacker spirit, and am fascinated by intricate program structures and algorithms. But your boss just need one who solve problems, them don't care about computer science. To solve a problem, you have to consider many things other than the computer - namely, the people around you. And that's exactly what software engineering does - to use some engineering methods to prevent or eliminate mistakes made by humans. So when I focus on hacking, I must keep an open mind on other skills, especially those methodologies for problem-solving.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] Keep up learning English</li>
<li>[ ] Read <em>Understanding the Linux Kernel</em> (I'm not sure if I can finish it)</li>
<li>[x] Keep up daily LeetCode exercises</li>
<li>[ ] Keep up writing blogs, basically one post a month</li>
<li>[x] Read some non-technical books</li>
<li>[x] Keep up exercises</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>I finished learning <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</em>, an amazing book. Its content comprised of functional programming, layering of program and data structure, OOP, infinite streams, the metacircular evaluator, lazy evaluation, compilation principle, etc. I have to say, <em>SICP</em> opened the gate of computer science for me. Before then, I don't really comprehend the essential of computer science.</p>

<h2>LeetCode</h2>
<p>I kept on doing LeetCode like the past few years. The grid looks not bad.</p>

<p>Now I've solved 1182 problems. Last year it's 912, so I solved 270 problems in 2023.</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>I kept learning English in 2023, as I did in the past few years. After continuously learning vocabulary on the APP <em>baicizhan</em> for 2024 days, I found it might not be a very effective way to memorize new words for me at the moment. Therefore, In November, I started learning <em>Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder</em>. This book organizes words by their roots, besides telling you how to use a word, its history, and related knowledge.</p>

<p>I also read another amazing vocabulary builder, <em>Word Power Made Easy</em>. To me, this book like an introduction to the etymology and at the same time teaches you how to memorize over 3,000 words and continue building your vocabulary.</p>

<p>In addition, I kept leaning Japanese on Duolingo as I did in 2022.</p>

<h2>Creating</h2>
<p>I only wrote 6 posts on the blog.</p>
<p>I created a repo <a href="https://github.com/luyuhuang/nvim">luyuhuang/nvim</a>, but it's just for personal configuration, should not be considered as a contribution. I submitted some pull requests and issues to the community and some of have been accepted.</p>
<h2>Something Happy</h2>
<p>Hiking and seeing the skyline of the city at the summit is quite happy, especially with the one you love.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>
<p>At the end of a year, I always feel time flies by quickly. But after I wrote the annual review, I found that the time of a year is quite long, because you can literally do many things in a year and grow quite a bit in certain aspects (say, I found my English writing skill is much better than the last year). So in the new year, keep learning and growing, and I believe we'll get a better result. Happy New Year to everybody.</p>
