<p>On September 15, 2017, the first day I joined the company, I told myself that I joined a good company which has a good treatment but I was not feeling happy at all. I had plenty of worry and confusion at that moment because I didn't know my direction.</p>
<p>All I can do is working hard and learning as much as possible.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2019, I told myself that 2019 is crucial for me. I must do something that will allow me to seize the opportunity that gives me a clear direction.</p>
<p>Time flies and many events happened in 2019. Maybe it didn't meet my expectations, but fortunately I didn't feel regret.</p>
<p>Today is January 1, 2020, it's time to make a summary.</p>
<h2>Annual Targets</h2>
<h3>Unfinished Targets</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Read Lua source code</p>
<p>I didn't finish reading the code, I only read part of it. But it's a start, I have started to understand some of these principles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finish <a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/">OpenGL tutorial</a></p>
<p>I didn't have time to learn it since I didn't finish reading Lua source code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Read 10 books</p>
<p>Only 6.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finished Targets</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Memorize words every day</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finish reading <em>CLRS</em>, and then read <em>TCP/IP Illustrated</em></p>
<p>I did it. But the translation of <em>TCP/IP Illustrated</em> is too bad, So I read <em>Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications</em> instead of it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>English</h2>
<p>I kept remembering words every day and completed daily plan every day except June 22 due to too busy that day to finish the plan before 00:00.</p>

<p>I have been remembering words for 605 days. I'm not good at language learning and I used to hate English. Nevertheless, for programmers, English is essential and it's a basic skill. I have overcome many difficulties and now I can read English articles more easily. In the future I hope I can hold on and improve writing and speaking skills.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished reading <em>CLRS</em> except the last two chapter due to I didn't have enough mathematical knowledge to understand it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I read about 1/3 of <em>Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have been doing algorithmic exercises on <a href="https://leetcode-cn.com/">LeetCode</a> since June. It's difficult for me, but this is the beginning.</p>
<p><img alt="leetcode" src="/media/wwww/share/study/聚聚/源数据/博客聚合/luyuhuang.github.io/source/assets/images/2019-annual-summary_2.png"/></p>
</li>
<li><p>I built <a href="https://luyuhuang.github.io">my tech blog</a> and wrote 17 posts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have been contributing on GitHub since September, it taught me a lot.</p>
<p><img alt="github" src="/media/wwww/share/study/聚聚/源数据/博客聚合/luyuhuang.github.io/source/assets/images/2019-annual-summary_3.png"/></p>
<p>I hope it'll be full of green spots in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I read part of Lua source code following <a href="https://github.com/lichuang/Lua-Source-Internal">this guide</a>. I have understood some of these principles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I read 6 books in 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Tale of Genji</em></li>
<li><em>A Tale of Two Cities</em></li>
<li><em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em></li>
<li><em>No Longer Human</em></li>
<li><em>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em></li>
<li><em>Journey Under the Midnight Sun</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The two books that impressed me most were <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> and <em>Journey Under the Midnight Sun</em>.</p>
<h2>Something Happy</h2>
<p>On November 9 I attended the <em>LisAni! LIVE Beijing</em> concert and met Nitta Emi. This is my happiest day in years.</p>
<p><img alt="concert" src="/media/wwww/share/study/聚聚/源数据/博客聚合/luyuhuang.github.io/source/assets/images/2019-annual-summary_4.jpg"/></p>
<h2>Finally</h2>
<p>The most comforting is that I still love programming despite I graduated from college over 2 years. I feel so happy: what I work every day is what I love. I hope to keep it like this in the future.</p>
<p>I hope to make some changes in the future, I hope I won't feel confused in the future.</p>
<p>Hello 2020. It must be a new beginning.</p>
