<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is JiaoYuan. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Environmental Science and Engineering from Chengdu University of Technology in 2025. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree at Sichuan University, specializing in Bioinformatics under the guidance of Professor Tao Ma.My current research interests lie in evolutionary genomics, machine learning, and foundation models for biology.</p>
<p>As a proponent of free software, I have been a dedicated user of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> since 2021. However, due to the demands of my field, I also utilize the Windows operating system. My work primarily involves data analysis using Python and shell scripting.</p>

You can subscribe to my blog <a href="https://jiaoyuan.org/index.xml">via RSS</a> or follow the WeChat public account "猫四叔" (Uncle Cat) for the latest updates.
