<h2>tags: [notion]</h2>
<p>I have built a Chrome extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E6%97%A0%E7%94%A8%E4%B8%BB%E6%84%8F%E6%A0%87%E7%AD%BE%E9%A1%B5/lieiofhdejclfpflofeooilpeaphlcgd?hl=zh-CN">无用主意</a> during the last month. The backend service implemented by Flask is using Notion as a dashboard.</p>

<h2>Notion API</h2>
<p>If you want your service to connect to Notion, you have to create a Notion integration on <a href="https://www.notion.so/my-integrations">this page</a>. Afterward, you have to share a specific Notion page with the integration you just created.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/20220731213331.png"/></p>
<p>Now, you can call <a href="https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro">Notion API</a> to visit your page.</p>
<p>Once the service has permission to write and read data to Notion, we can sync data between them.</p>
<p>I'm using a <code>status</code> column to let me know which row has been updated in the service's SQLite database.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/20220731212654.png"/></p>
<p>And also, I can update this row's content, then mark the <code>status</code> as "To Update" to tell Flask service to sync this line later. Every night, the Flask service sync data from the Notion page to SQLite and marks the <code>status</code> as "Done".</p>
<p>In this way, I am making Notion my backend service dashboard.</p>
