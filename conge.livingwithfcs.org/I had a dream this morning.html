<p>In the dream, I was in a hospital.&lt;div&gt;I asked a nurse for a bed because I believed that I would be sick very soon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"When will you be sick? Are you in pain now?" She asked.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I am fine now, but I will have abdominal pain in about two hours", I replied.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Come back when you are in pain." She refused my request.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, I grabbed a book from a table and sat down in the room, waiting for my pain to come.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I woke up. It was 7 am.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I ate my breakfast and everything seemed fine. I went to school and started the day by reading slides about Presentation programming.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then, I felt pain around 10 am. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My body does tell. I should listen more carefully.&lt;/div&gt;</p>
