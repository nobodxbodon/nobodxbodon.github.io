&lt;p&gt;This week I visited CVS twice on 8/6 and 8/7. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first time I got Colgate toothpaste, Gillette razor and two Sobe Life water ($16 tag price), used $6.75 coupon and $7.99 ECB. Paid&lt;strong&gt; 0.98 out of pocket&lt;/strong&gt; and got 7.00 ECB.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then I found out I was about to be out of Vitamin C. I found out CVS has Ester-C BOGO and I had 2 $3/1 coupons. I just cannot miss this deal. So came the second trip to CVS. This time I got 2 bottles of Ester-C and another Colgate toothpaste ($24.57 tag price), used $6 coupon and  $8 ECB. Paid&lt;strong&gt; $0.74&lt;/strong&gt; out of pocket and got another $2 ECB to roll next week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, two trips to CVS, got $40.58 worth of product. Paid $1.72 out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Good deal!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The trip to Rite Aid was also fun except that I forgot to spend my UPRs. Have to spend them next week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At Rite Aid, I got $38.45 worth of product, used $15.25 coupons, paid $20.89 out of pocket and earned 6.55 UPRs + $10.99 SCR.&lt;/p&gt;
