<h2>1. Intro</h2>
<p>The <strong>learning to predict</strong> problem:  using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior.  Important advantage: training examples can be taken directly from the temporal sequence of ordinary sensory input: no special supervisor or teacher is required.</p>
<p>Temporal-difference (TD) methods are driven by the error or difference between temporally successive predictions; with them, learning occurs whenever there is a change in prediction over time.</p>
<p>TD methods are both more <em>accurate</em> and <em>easier</em> to compute ( more incremental).</p>
<h2>2. Temporal difference and supervised learning approaches to prediction.</h2>
<p><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: given input-output pairs, the learner learns the system so it can give output if presented with an input. It ignores the sequential structure of the problem.</p>
<h3>2.1 Single-step vs multi-step learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>single-step prediction problems</strong>, all information about the correctness
of each prediction is revealed at once. </li>
<li>In <strong>multi-step prediction problems,</strong> correctness is not revealed until more than one step after the prediction is made, but partial information relevant to its correctness is revealed at each step.</li>
</ul>
<p>In real life, prediction are often based on information coming in as a temporal stream other than getting all the observation-outcome pairs all at the same time. the <strong>multi-step</strong> model is more in line with real life.</p>
<h3>2.2 Computational issue</h3>
<p>TD procedure is incremental and requires less computation power.</p>
