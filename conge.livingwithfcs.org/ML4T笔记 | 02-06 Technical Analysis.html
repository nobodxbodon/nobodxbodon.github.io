<h1>01 - Technical versus fundamental analysis</h1>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-a36ac8be1c537a46.png"/></p>
<p>Two broad categories of approaches to use for choosing stocks to buy or sell: <strong>Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fundamental analysis</strong>:  looking at aspects of a company to estimate its value and look for the price &lt; value situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>earnings, dividends, cash flow, book value  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical analysis</strong>: Looking for patterns or trends in a stock's price.</p>

<h1>02 - Characteristics</h1>
<p><strong>Characteristics of technical analysis</strong>
<img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-3e17ab812194b2d8.png"/></p>
<ol>
<li>it looks only at price and volume.</li>
<li>compute statistics (or indicators) on this time series<ul>
<li><strong>Indicators</strong> are heuristics that may hint at a buy or sell opportunity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Criticism of the technical approach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it's not an appropriate method for investing, because it's not considering the value of the companies.</li>
<li>trading approach as opposed to an investing approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons to believe technical analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>there is indeed information in price and information in a price change.</li>
<li>Stock price and price change reflects sentiments of buyers and sellers</li>
<li>in other domains of artificial intelligence, heuristics can work, and they work frequently.<blockquote><p>Time: 00:01:40</p>

<h1>03 - Quiz: Potential indicators</h1>
<p><strong>Look at each one of these four factors and fill in the box, T for technical or F for fundamental.</strong>
<img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-2f575635c6db7216.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>the moving average of price is only using price [technical.]</li>
<li>Percent change in volume is only using volume [technical].</li>
<li>price/earnings, earning is a fundamental factor, which makes the whole [fundamental].</li>
<li>intrinsic value is based on dividends [a fundamenta]</li>
</ul>

<h1>04 - When is technical analysis valuable</h1>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-5fb7a31629bde0ad.png"/></p>
<ol>
<li>individual indicators, by themselves, are weakly predictive. And the more people following a particular approach, the less value is realized</li>
<li>combining multiple indicators adds value. Combinations of three to five different indicators, in a machine learning context, provide a much stronger predictive system</li>
<li>contrasts. If certain stocks are behaving differently than the market, then they are worth a further look.</li>
<li>technical analysis generally works better over shorter time periods.</li>
</ol>

<h1>05 - When is technical analysis valuable part 2</h1>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-1b7a4c926dd0578d.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The trading horizon</strong></p>
<p><strong>For fundamental factors</strong>: Over long periods of time, fundamental factors provide a lot of value.</p>
<ul>
<li>For trading machines on the stock exchange, the order book or momentum, etc really matter, and the fundamental factors really have low value.</li>
<li>fundamental factors over long periods of time may have significant value.</li>
<li>over a period of days, Fundamental factors do have value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>for technical factors</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>over long terms technical analysis is not so valuable.</li>
<li>technical factors potentially have high value over very short periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>decision complexity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Computer-based trading</p>
<ul>
<li>we have to be able to make the decisions really, really fast if we're trading at the millisecond level.</li>
<li><p>at this very high-frequency trading, the complexity of decisions is simple. And computers excel in this region of the chart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the high-frequency trading computer-driven hedge funds are short in the trading horizon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>human investors</p>
<ul>
<li>we can take a long time to make a decision if we're going to buy and hold for years.</li>
<li>If taking a long time to make a decision, it is the best region for human investors.</li>
<li>The insight-driven, human-based hedge funds are operating over a long trading horizon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there is a middle where we often see humans and computers working together.</li>

<h1>06 - A few indicators: Momentum</h1>
<p>Three are some of the most common and most popular indicators: 1) momentum, 2( simple moving average, and 3) Bollinger Bands.</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-624a2faf6f6a08b0.png"/></p>
<p><strong>momentum</strong></p>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-ad2dcc32ef833497.png"/></p>
<p>Momentum is over some number of days how much has the price changed: <strong>positive momentum</strong> and <strong>negative momentum</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The steepness of that line is the strength of the momentum, either positive or negative.</p>
</li>
<li><p>convert numbers<br/>
momentum, N days of momentum.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the pseudo code for how we compute momentum on a particular day. <code>momentum[t] = price[t]/price[t - n] -1</code>, n is the number of days between two time point.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>07 - A few indicators: Simple moving average (SMA).</h1>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-2bce55cafa7c4467.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>SMA for today is simply the average of the values over this look back window.</li>
<li>the SMA looks essentially like a smoothed value of the price chart as it moves around.</li>
<li>SMA lags the movement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>two different ways that technicians use simple moving average</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>look for where the current price crosses through the simple moving average.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>combine that with momentum: the price has strong momentum, and it's crossing through that simple moving average, that can be a signal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>strong momentum crossing those lines, then again, that can be a trading signal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>simple moving average is as a proxy for underlying value.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The average price might represent the true value of the company.</li>
<li>we should expect that the price is eventually going to regress to that average. ( it's an arbitrage opportunity)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>quantify SMA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>compare the current price with the current simple moving average, and construct a ratio.</li>
<li><code>SMA[t] = price[n]/price[t-n:t].mean() -1</code></li>
<li>This value ranges from -50% to +50%.</li>
</ul>

<h1>08 - A few indicators Bollinger Bands</h1>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-608f9d6e22e21405.png"/></p>
<p><strong>how much of an excursion from the simple moving average should I use as a signal for a buy or sell?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a fixed number is probably not the best way to go.</li>
<li>John Bollinger observed that for low volatility, use a smaller excursion for that trigger. For high volatility, use a larger number.</li>
<li><strong>the Bollinger Bands</strong>: take this simple moving average, but let's add a band above and below 2 std (standard deviations).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How might we use Bollinger Bands now for trading signals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>look for times where the price's outside one of these Bollinger Bands and when it crosses to the inside it should be a trading signal.</li>
<li>Moving from above the band and cross to the inside, <strong>selling signal</strong></li>
<li>Moving from below the band and cross to the inside, <strong>buying signal</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to calculate the Bollinger Band on a particular day t</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>BB[t] = (Price[t] -SMA[t]) / (2*std[t])</code></li>
<li>BB[t] = -1 or BB[t] = 1 are the crossing point.</li>
<li>BB[t -1] &gt; 1and BB[t] = 1 and BB[t+1] &gt; 1, then Sell</li>
<li>BB[t -1] &lt; -1and BB[t] = -1 and BB[t+1] &lt;- 1, then buy</li>
<li>typically expect to BB[t] is between -1 and 1.</li>
<li>occasionally, we'll see excursions above and below those values.</li>
</ul>

<h1>09 - Buy or sell</h1>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-7401061378f48fc0.png"/></p>
<p>In the four different times where the actual price crosses and upper or lower Bollinger band. Is it a buy signal, a sell signal or no signal at all?</p>
<p>The solution: is in the picture: remember, only when price moves into the Bollinger Band is a trading signal. Moving outside is not.</p>
<blockquote><p>Time: 00:00:57</p>

<h1>10 - Normalization</h1>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-ffd0b252cbca8a3d.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple moving average and momentum are bouned in [-.5, +.5] and Bollinger bands in [-1, 1].</li>
<li>When used in a machine learner Bollinger Band factor would tend to overwhelm these other factors and [falsely] become the most important one.</li>
<li>It might get even worse if we included fundamental factor like PE ratio ranges in [1, 300]</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution: <strong>normalization</strong>.</p>
<p>Given values, the normalization works this way:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>normalized_values = [values - mean(values)] / std(values)</code></li>
<li>normalized_values will range in [-1, 1] and have a mean of 0.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>⚠️!!Normalize your data if use indicators in machine learning models!!</strong></p>
