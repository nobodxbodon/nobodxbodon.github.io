<li>CAMP is one of the most significant ideas affecting finance in the last century.</li>
<li>CAMP explains how the market impacts individual stock prices.</li>
<li>CAMP provides a mathematical framework for hedge fund investing.</li>
<li>It was developed by a number of researchers independently in the 1960s.</li>
<li>William Sharpe, Harry Markowitz, and Merton Miller jointly received the Nobel Prize for this contribution in 1990.</li>
<li>The CAPM led to the development of index funds and the belief that you can't beat the market</li>

<h1>02 - Definition of a portfolio</h1>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-4cd1489e0a0ed103.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A portfolio is a weighted set of assets.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g.: a portfolio that's got three different assets in it, Apple, Google, and Oracle. 60% in Apple, 20% in Google, and 20% in Oracle. <ul>
<li>60%, 20% are the weights (w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) </li>
<li>$\sum abs(w_i) = 100\%$ ( leveraged portfolio is a exception).</li>
<li>returns on a portfolio: $R<em>p(t) = \sum</em>{i =1}^{n}(w_i * R_i(t))$, n = number of stocks in the portfolio.</li>
<li>the equation allows short porsition and the return of it is opposite to the markect change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the portfolio and return of the stocks in it, calculate portfolio return</p>
<p>Solution: 
portfolio return = 75% <em> 1% + (-25%) </em> (-2%) = 1.25%</p>
<ul>
<li>the weight for Stock A is .75 and the return is 1% </li>
<li>the weight for Stock B is negative 25% and return is  2% .</li>
<li>since we shorted B and it went down, we got a positive component there, or .5.</li>

<h1>04 - The market portfolio</h1>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-3731ec5d7427e2fc.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The Market Portfolio</strong> usually referring to is an index that broadly covers a large set of stocks.</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. S&amp;P500. The S&amp;P 500 represents the 500 largest companies that are traded</li>
<li>The index changes each day according to the prices of all of its components.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The market portfolio is a combination of those stocks in a certain weighting.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cap Weighted: the weight of each stock in the index portfolio is usually set according to that stock's market cap ($ w_i = number\ of\ shares_i * price<em>i / \sum</em>{j=1}^{n}(market_Cap_j)$).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sectors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the US we typically break the market into ten different sectors, list four of them here. E.g.: Energy, technology, manufacturing, finance and so on.</li>
<li>positive and negative news can affect each of these sectors individually without necessarily affecting the others.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's not unusual to break up these large markets into individual sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: some stocks have surprisingly large weightings (e.g. Apple and Exxon each are about 5% of the S&amp;P 500) thus have a strong effect on what happens to this index.</p>

<h1>05 - The CAPM equation</h1>

<p>The capital assets pricing model equation.</p>
<blockquote><p>$r_i(t) = \beta_i * r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t)$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$ r_i(t)$: The return of a particular stock, i, on a particular day,
$\beta * r_m(t) $: the return for a particular stock due to the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>the market moving up or down strongly affects the change in price on every individual stock and $\beta$ is the extent of effects.</li>
<li>every stock has it's own $\beta$.</li>
<li>$\alpha$  is called the residual which is the part that $\beta$ cannot predict.</li>
<li><strong>In the capital assets pricing model, the expectation for $\alpha$ is 0.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do we get this $\beta$ and this $\alpha$?</strong></p>
<p>Depends on how the daily returns for a particular stock $r_i(t)$ related to the daily returns of the market $r_m(t)$.</p>
<ul>
<li>plot returns here for S&amp;P 500 ($r_m(t)$.) against the daily return of an individual stock xyz ($r_i(t)$.) and fit a line to it. Then $\beta$ is the slop and $\alpha$ is the y-intercept.</li>
<li>$\alpha$ and $\beta$ is based on historical data. in CAPM $\alpha$ are expect to be 0 (not always 0 in reality)</li>
</ul>

<h1>06 - quiz: Compare alpha and beta</h1>
<p><img alt=" " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-d893d464a3c540ea.png"/></p>
<p>Of the two plots, which one has higher alpha and which one has a higher beta?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:
Correlated with SP500, ABC clearly has a greater slope than XYZ, therefore higher β. It also has a larger Y-intercept (α).</p>

<h1>07 - CAPM vs active management</h1>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-a019aa80215578cd.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>passive investing</strong>: essentially says that you should just buy an index portfolio, hold and let it grow.</li>
<li><strong>Active investing</strong>: Active portfolio managers don't just buy the index portfolio, they pick individual stocks. s/he weights some stocks higher and others lowers, and select higher weighted ones for his/her portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>consider passive versus active in that context</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both active managers and passive managers agree that the stock moves each day is most significantly influenced by the market $\beta * r_m(t)$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The CAPM the $\alpha$ is 1) random and 2) expected to be zero.</p>
</li>
<li>Active managers believe they can predict $\alpha$ relative to the market.</li>
<li>a passive investor believes the capital assets pricing model, 
Just buy an index and hold it.</li>
<li>and active investor believes they or some else can find $\alpha$.</li>

<p><strong>the return for the entire portfolio</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>compute this return for each individual stock$r_i(t)$, multiply it by the weight for that stock and then we take the sum across all the stocks. </li>
<li>$r_p(t) = \sum(r_i(t) <em> w_i)$ (remember $r_i(t) = \beta_i </em> r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t))$</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New way to calculate Beta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$\beta_p = \sum(w_i(t) <em> \beta_i) $ and $\alpha_p = \sum(w_i(t) </em> \alpha_i(t))$
Thus, </li>
<li>$r_p(t) = \beta_p * r_m(t) + \alpha_p$ for CAMP</li>
<li>$r_p(t) = \beta_p <em> r_m(t) + \sum_i(w_i </em> alpha_i(t))$ <blockquote><p>Time: 00:02:04</p>

<h1>9 - quiz: Implications of CAPM Quiz</h1>
<p>Consider the implications of the CAPM, and implications in upward markets and downward markets.</p>
<p>If we're in upward markets, do you want a larger beta or a smaller beta? And if we're in downward markets, do you want a larger beta or a smaller beta?</p>
<p><img alt="  " src="/Users/xuanwu/work/聚聚/中文博客集锦/源数据/博客聚合/conge.livingwithfcs.org/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-9ddd7931b4e9c225.png"/></p>
<p><strong>solution</strong>:
| market   | stock  | 
| -------- | ------ | 
| Upward   | larger | 
| Downward | smaller  |</p>

<ul>
<li>$\alpha$ is random, and the expected value of alpha is zero.</li>
<li>the only way we can beat the market now is by cleverly choosing $\beta$, <strong>high $\beta$ in up markets and low $\beta$ in down markets</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>the efficient markets hypothesis</strong> says you can't predict the market which means $\beta$ is not predictable.</li>
<li>taken together, CAMP and <strong>the efficient markets hypothesis</strong> say that <strong>you can't beat the market</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now, we are on to ways that you can potentially beat the market</strong></p>

<h1>11 - Arbitrage Pricing Theory</h1>

<ul>
<li>Arbitrage Pricing Theory was developed by Stephen Ross and first published in 1976.</li>
<li>Dr. Ross though using single beta that represents a particular stock's relationship to the market is not enough; Maybe multiple $\beta s$ against different sectors.</li>
<li>And of course we still have our $\alpha$.</li>
<li>$r<em>p(t) = \beta</em>{iF}<em>r<em>F + \beta</em>{iT} </em> r<em>T + \beta</em>{iM} * r_M + ... ... + \alpha_i$</li>
