<p>坦白的说，我对于临床心理学所知不多。本科的时候我并没有时间和机会去修一些临床心理学的课程，而研究生时我赶上了北大的两年制试点，毕业的压力更加让我不能去修那些基础课程。而北大临床心理学方向的几位先生要求都非常严格，如果没有先修基础课的话，就不能去修研究生级别的临床心理学，旁听都不可以。于是便错过了。&lt;br /&gt;好在我们还可以自学，毕竟看书是不必要别人同意的。这里是一本关于心理治疗的书籍，点击下面的阅读全文按钮你就可以看到简介。如果对你有帮助，就尽管下载吧。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.douban.com/lpic/s1889458.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;" src="http://www.douban.com/lpic/s1889458.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;作者: Lisa B. Moschini&lt;br /&gt;副标题: Art Therapy with the Difficult Client&lt;br /&gt;isbn: 0471687731&lt;br /&gt;定价: USD 49.95&lt;br /&gt;出版社: Wiley&lt;br /&gt;装帧: Paperback&lt;br /&gt;出版年: 2004-12-24&lt;br /&gt;文件大小：18.0MB&lt;br /&gt;文件格式：PDF&lt;br /&gt;简介　· · · · · ·　&lt;br /&gt;This resourceful guide presents art therapy techniques for difficult clients where the typical therapist-client interaction can often be distant, demanding, and frustrating. Offering practical and theoretical information from a wide variety of treatment populations and diagnostic categories; and incorporating individual, group, and family therapy case studies, the text is filled with examples and over 150 illustrations taken from the author’s sixteen years of experience working with hundreds of clients. The author is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist with a Master’s degree in Clinical Art Therapy. The text comes with an accompanying CD-ROM which includes full-color pictures and additional material not found in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing the Line: Art Therapy with the Difficult Client&lt;/span&gt; is intended for all who have felt frustration when faced with a resistant or difficult client. &lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;In my experience as a practicing therapist, supervisor, and lecturer I have had the opportunity to listen to a myriad of clinicians discuss this very topic. What defines the difficult client? Is there a set of criteria that can be applied to the whole of the population? One common definition that fits each individual?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fourteen years of clinical practice that singular definition has remained elusive. Instead, what I have found is a common reaction or affectladen response centered on the therapist’s exasperation. A feeling of helplessness sometimes embedded in anger, at other times couched in pleas for assistance. A threat to the clinician’s own confidence. At this point, we have become not only the transference object but also an object of countertransference: A response to the patient-therapist interaction based on emotional feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now the question takes on further complexity. How can we as clinicians provide opportunities of growth for both our clients and ourselves? One answer is art psychotherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a psychodynamic therapist I believe development is epigenetic and take note of the unconscious processes that drive the individual as he or she maneuvers through his or her environment. As an art psychotherapist, I have learned to interpret these unconscious and repetitious symbols. Thus, the visual experience takes the place of language as a nonverbal means of communication. A picture always speaks the truth. Regardless of age or ability, art never lies. It may reveal only one side, one moment within the here and now, one facet, but that facet is the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To that end I invite each reader to participate in a brief and very personal expression, for without looking within ourselves how are we to help others? Without understanding there can be no growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;About the Author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa B.
