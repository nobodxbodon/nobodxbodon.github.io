<p>一个常见误区是：使用硬件必需一个“操作系统”。Forth 编程语言作者 Chuck Moore 的访谈节选（<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/masterminds-of-programming/9780596801670/">《Masterminds of Programming》 by Federico Biancuzzi</a>）：</p>
<p>（访问者） On one hand you have a language that really enables people to develop their own vocabularies and not necessarily think about the hardware presentation. On the other hand, you have a very small kernel that’s very much tied to that hardware. It’s interesting how Forth can bridge the gap between the two. <strong><em>On some of these machines, is it true that you have no operating system besides your Forth kernel?</em></strong></p>
<p>Chuck: No, Forth is really standalone. Everything that needs to exist is in the kernel.</p>
<p>（访问者）But it abstracts away that hardware for people who write programs in Forth.</p>
<p>Chuck: Right.</p>
<p>（访问者）The Lisp Machine did something similar, but never really was popular. Forth quietly has done that job.</p>
<p>Chuck: Well, Lisp did not address I/O. In fact, C did not address I/O and because it didn’t, it needed an operating system. Forth addressed I/O from the very beginning. I don’t believe in the most common denominator. I think that if you go to a new machine, the only reason it’s a new machine is because it’s different in some way and you want to take advantage of those differences. So, you want to be there at the input-output level so you can do that.</p>
