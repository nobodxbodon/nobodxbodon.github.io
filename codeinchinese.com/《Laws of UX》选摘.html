<p>2020年《Laws of UX - Using Psychology to Design Better Products &amp; Services》，作者：Jon Yablonski</p>
<h2>前言</h2>
<p>designers can, I believe, use psychology as a guide, enabling them to design for how people actually perceive, process, and interact not only with gigital interfaces but also with the world.</p>
<h2>第一章 Jakob's Law</h2>
<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.</p>
<p>求同。</p>
<h2>第四章 Miller's Law</h2>
<p>The average person can keep only 7 (+/-2) items in their working memory.</p>
<h2>第五章 Postel's Law</h2>
<p>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.</p>
<p>Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.</p>
<p>对各色输入尽量宽容，同时保持提供易理解的反馈。</p>
<h2>第六章 Peak-End Rule</h2>
<p>People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.</p>
<p>Remember that people recall negative experiences more vividly than positive ones.</p>
<p>对负面体验更深刻，也许是进化中避险本能的一部分。但这在育儿时，不应放任其自溺于负面回忆中，而应以身作则看到无处不在的正面色彩。</p>
<p>在编程工具方面，用户最需要帮助的时刻之一应该是出错或与预期效果不同时。这也是现在多数ai编程工具提供的无缝反馈的价值所在，即无论什么要求（结合上一章），在工具内总有一定反馈。</p>
<h2>第七章 Aesthetic-Usability Effect</h2>
<p>Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable.</p>
<p>People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h2>第八章 von Restorff Effect</h2>
<p>When multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.</p>
<p>求异。</p>
<h2>第九章 Tesler's Law</h2>
<p>also known as the law of conservation of complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced.</p>
<p>All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user.</p>
<p>对AI编程的过分乐观态度往往来自于在极短时间内生成大量看似可用的代码的「峰值」体验，而往往忽视一旦进入维护改进阶段就呈非线性上升的人力开销。更不用说并不自动保留、无法复现的开发过程。</p>
<h2>第十章 Doherty Threshold</h2>
<p>Provide system feedback within 400 ms in order to keep users' attention and increase productivity.</p>
<p>对于编程工具开发来说，可以尝试从语言环境层面提供一个「准实时系统」，即任何输入都可以在400ms内得到某个反馈，无论执行情况如何。即便是死循环，也可以提供一个旁白。</p>
<p>Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its percieved value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process itself actually takes much less time.</p>
<p>如果代码执行非常迅速并返回，可以考虑提供某些类似profile的深度反馈，用户可选择性查阅。比如「遍历了xx文件中的xxx行」。</p>
<h2>第十一章 With Power Comes Responsibility</h2>
<p>Skinner's research</p>
<p>《Addiction by Design》</p>
<p>Data collected about user behavior can be used to fine-tune how a system responds to an individual, and these methods are constantly incresing in sophistication and accuracy, while the psychological hardware we share as humans remains the same.</p>
<p>从古到今，用于操弄民意的手段其实一以贯之。网络只是一个超大的传声筒和及其灵活的声量放大/缩小工具。内容创造自动化实际上让更多民众更依赖于极少数信道，更降低了操弄信息交流的难度。</p>
<p>When FB introduced the 'like' button in 2009, they probably didn't intend for it to become such an addictive feedback mechanism, providing a small dopamine hit of social affirmation to uses who found themselves returning to the app time an time again to measure their self-worth.</p>
<p>we should build technology that augments the human experience rither than replacing it with virtual interaction and rewards.</p>
<p>当下的ai交互是加强还是削弱人际交流呢？</p>
<p>No longer is "mosing fast and breaking things" an acceptable means of building technology-instead, we must slow down and be intentional with the technology we create, and consider how it's impacting people's lives.</p>
<p>此书出版后这这五年来，世界大环境的变化使得“慢下来”愈发成为奢侈。更多的资金和人力卷入到基于大数据和高算力的 ai 泡沫中。</p>
<p>We can make ethical design decisions by acknowledging how the human mind can be exploited and take accountability for our work by thinking beyond the happy path scenarios, building more diverse teams, and talking with users to gain qualitative feedback on how the products and experiences we build affect their lives.</p>
<p>首先要有和「真人」交互的机会，而现有大多数网络平台都被热榜的对立话题吸引了眼球，使得越来越少真人愿意参与发声以避负面言论冲击。<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/6387928079/answer/52041127828">通过蓝牙等本地组网</a> 也许是条路。</p>
<h2>第十二章 Applying Psychological Principles in Design</h2>
<p>According to Hick's law （第三章）,...
To achive this goal, we must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit choices to no more than 3 items at a time.</li>
<li>Provide brief explanations when useful that are clear and no more than 80 characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>为减轻用户心智负担，选项和解释都会尽量简约。这就很考验语言的效率。在可读性方面中文有 <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/405766658/answer/1327906058">相对优势</a>。</p>
